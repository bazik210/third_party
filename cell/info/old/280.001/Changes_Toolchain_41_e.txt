======================================================================
The following are the new features and fixed bugs of PLAYSTATION(R)3 
Programmer Tool Toolchain package. 

- Additions of new features and changes in Release 280.001
- Bugs fixed in Release 280.001

======================================================================
New Additions and Changes in Release 280.001
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SN Systems Linker
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Additions]
(B#68110)
- Implemented the --package switch. Using this switch places all 
  inputs into a single zip file, along with a link response file to 
  replicate the link the zip file was created with.

(B#68111)
- Implemented compressed FSELF support. Compression is enabled via 
  the --compress-output switch when producing FSELF output.

[Specification Changes]
(B#70848)
- Deprecated the --no-keep-memory option. The current implementation 
  only works in limited circumstances; the option may be removed 
  pending review of its usefulness.

(B#70847)
- Deprecated the --external-make-fself option. Changes to the 
  make_fself tool make it difficult to implement correctly.

(B#67212)
- Permit symbols from an object file to redefine those in an archive.

[Bugfixes]
(B#71092)
- Fix a spurious undefined symbol error when dead stripping code 
  containing overlapping symbols.

(B#67957)
- Implemented more efficient PRX generation.

(B#70265)
- Previously --strip-unused incorrectly enabled dead stripping 
  on data sections with the SHF_MERGE flag set.
  Fixed the dead stripping configuration so that --strip-unused-data 
  enables this behaviour, and --strip-unused leaves such sections 
  alone.

(B#72051)
- Warning L0095 did not emit the object file name for archives 
  previously; now it does.

(B#69641)
- Corrected an error that caused --no-keep-memory to produce broken 
  output.

(B#66794)
- Fix a failure in the internal PRX fixup that occurred when linking 
  relocatable output containing PRX stubs.

(B#67399)
- Correct inconsistencies between the linker manual and the program 
  help text.

(B#67414)
- Fix a crash when using the --defsym command-line switch.

(B#67111)
- Fix failure to link when THIS_CELL_SDK environment variable is not 
  set under Linux.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
GCC
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Additions]
<PPU>
(B#54159)
- when using option -mno-toc GCC will generate code that does not 
  use the TOC for accessing any data, does not save and restore the 
  TOC register for function pointer calls, and does not add a nop 
  instruction after regular function calls.

[Specification Changes]
<PPU/SPU>
(B#52010)
- (ppu/spu)-lv2-gccbug has been removed from Toolchain Package.

<PPU>
(B#66953)
- Added "T (TLS: thread local storage)" in the "Key to Flags" that 
  is shown by ppu-lv2-readelf with -S option.

<SPU>
(B#70890)
- The location of job_crt.o has been changed from the SDK package 
  to the toolchain package.

    Old location in SDK package:
      target\spu\lib\job_crt.o
      target\spu\lib\pic\job_crt.o

    New location in toolchain package:
      host-win32\spu\lib\gcc\spu-lv2\4.1.1\job_crt.o
      host-win32\spu\lib\gcc\spu-lv2\4.1.1\pic\job_crt.o

[Bugfixes]
<PPU/SPU>
(B#66952)
- In some cases with -fprofile-arcs or -fprofile-generate 
  and anonymous namepsaces, GCC would crash.
  This problem has now been fixed.

(B#67355)
- In some cases an internal compiler error in mark_operand_necessary 
  would happen.  This problem has now been fixed.

(B#67975)
- The following internal compiler error could happen if the 
  variable that is accessed via a different type hold an address of 
  another variable while inside a loop.

    internal compiler error: in for_each_index, at tree-ssa-loop-im.c:222

  This problem has been fixed.

(B#67976)
- The following internal compiler error would happen 
  when using induction variable that was accessed via a different 
  type with a component reference.

    internal compiler error: in expand_expr_addr_expr_1, at expr.c:6740

  This has been fixed.

(B#33722)
- Vector context sensitive keyword does not work with macros.
  This problem has now been fixed.

(B#56880)
- A response file with an empty line at the begining did not work.
  This problem has now been fixed.

(B#25449)
- Debugging information for __builtin_va_list defined 
  by the compiler was not generated.
  This has now been fixed.

(B#58092)
- ProDG watch could not find local variables.
  This problem has now been fixed.

(B#12256)
- When .debug_loc was generated, it was necessary to generate 
  DW_AT_entry_pc, but it was not generated.
  This has now been fixed.

<PPU>
(B#47040)
- When both -mno-sn-ld and --target-help were used, 
  the following error was displayed:

    Windows:
      cc1.exe: error: unrecognized command line option "---target-help"

    Linux:
      "a.out" can't open
      ppu-lv2-prx-fixup: 'a.out' can't read

  This has now been fixed.

(B#65930)
- Using section anchors in combination with the -strip-unused-data 
  linker option generated incorrect code.
  This has been fixed.

(B#70047)
- When linking libsupc++.a to PRXs, the following 
  link error occurred.
  This problem has been fixed.

    Error: '_ZZN11__sce_local10get_globalEvE6global' is TLS variable.
    PRX doesn't support TLS now!

(B#58074)
- An argument type of __frsp was not right.
  This has now been fixed.

<SPU>
(B#67265)
- When a program which requires runtime relocation was compiled 
  without -fpic and linked with -fpic and -mno-fixups options, 
  no warning was displayed.
  This bug has been fixed.

(B#67272)
- A warning like below was displayed even if 
  -mno-warn-reloc was specified.

    warning: section '.text' in 'xxxx.o' is non-PIC

  This problem has been fixed.
