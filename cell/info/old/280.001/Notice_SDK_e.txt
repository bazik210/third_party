======================================================================
The following are known bugs, limitations and cautions on 
the Reference Tool SDK package.

New updates have the release version of this package. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reference Tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- For specifications regarding the Reference Tool, please refer to 
  SDK_doc\jp(en)\pdf\development_basic\Reference_System-Supplement_*.pdf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Software
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Check menu in the Game column>
- Validation of a media or the file system itself cannot be performed 
  from the Check menu in the Game column.

  When submitting a master disc, make sure to verify the disc that no error
  is present using the Disc Image Generator for PLAYSTATION(R)3 or
  the Disc Image Checker for PLAYSTATION(R)3.

- When performing the check from the Check menu in the Game column, 
  if the number of result files exceeds approximately 80 to 100 depending 
  on each check item, the file entries of the root directory in the USB 
  mass storage run out and the subsequent check result files may no 
  longer be stored.
  In such case, move the check result files to another directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Utilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<On-Screen Keyboard Utility>
- The optional dictionary feature is not supported.

<Game Update Utility>
-  When the Reference Tool is booted having "Debugger mode" specified to
   "Boot parameters" using the Administration Tool or the like,
   the patch distribution feature of the Game Update utility cannot be
   utilized.

<Content Search Utility>
- When file paths to the still image and animation thumbnails of content
  are created using cellSearchPrepareFile() and the thumbnails are changed
  from the system software, the changes will not be reflected unless
  cellSearchPrepareFile() is executed again.

<Screenshot Utility>
- The value set to the PNG chunk is stored when it is copied from the 
  system software to an external media (Memory Stick(TM) or such), 
  however, when the stored data is imported into the system software, the 
  value is not reflected to the information screen of the system software.
  This is a current limitation but to be supported in the future system 
  software.

<Background Download utility>
- The following is a notice regarding the behavior of background downloads
  when they are performed while a game application is running.

  Although a background download will usually continue while a game
  application is running, it will be stopped by any one of the following
  conditions.

    - The game application has created more than one socket
    - There is more than one connection that uses the NP signaling utility
    - The AV chat utility or the AV chat 2 utility is being used

  The background download will resume once the condition that stopped it
  no longer applies. 
  Please do not create a game application that is dependent on the progress of
  background downloads.

  If new conditions are added to the above list of conditions that stop
  background downloads given the addition of a new utility, or if there are
  any changes regarding this issue, it will be announced in this technote.
  (TechnoteID:200803-15  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/708)

<Audio Configuration Utility>
- In the multi microphone mode, cellAudioInRegisterDevice() is executed with
  an audio input device type preferred by the application specified to the
  argument deviceType in order to resister the audio input device into
  the system.
  When cellAudioInRegisterDevice() is called, the system software
  automatically assign a device number regardless of whether a matching audio
  input device is found or not. Whether the audio input device that has the
  device number is available or not can be checked through polling using
  cellMicIsAttached() of libmic or an event notification from libmic.

  Since a device number is automatically assigned as described above,
  when multiple USB devices(audio input device) of the type that the game
  application prefers are connected to PLAYSTATION(R)3, which device being
  connected to a USB port has which device number cannot be uniquely
  identified.
  In such case, a user interface should be implemented to identify it such
  as by displaying an indicator (volume) or the like on the screen.
  Note that a mechanism that can explicitly assign a device number to
  a specific device will be provided in the future release.

<Video Upload Utility>
(Added to Release 280.001)
- The method to acquire client_id and developer_key that are required 
  to upload a movie file to YouTube has been changed. 
  Please refer to the following technote for more information:
  (Technote ID:200906-06  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/923)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libperf
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the Lv-2 system call trace is enabled with the back trace
  on the program that is linked with libperf.a of SDK170 or before,
  it does not work on the target system that is updated to SDK 180 and
  later.
  (applicable to libperf\ppu sample)
  Please use libperf.a that is released after SDK 180.

- (B#43808)
  The Tuner for PLAYSTATION(R)3 cannot be used to measure the performance
  of the sample program of libperf because the measurement module on
  the target is utilized.

- In DECR-1400, the external memory for tracing is not implemented. 
  Therefore, the external memory cannot be specified to the trace 
  buffer.
  If it is specified, EPERM (0x80010009) is returned as an error at 
  the time of call to cellPerfAddCBEpm().

  Accordingly, the samples\sdk\libperf\ppu sample will not work.

(Added to Release 280.001)
- (B#73661)
  When the system call trace of Lv-2 is enabled together with the back trace 
  feature and if a stack is placed in the VM area or the page fault 
  notification area, an exception error occurs in the target program.
  To avoid this problem, always place the stack in an area that is readable 
  or set the back trace size to 0 to disable the back trace feature. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmixer
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The sample value to be specified for the argument "samples" of
  cellSurMixerSurBusAddData() must be multiples of 4.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libsail
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When playing back a PAMF file, few frames(1 to 3 frames) at the end of
  a stream cannot be obtained.

- Only the playback of a MP4 file that is placed on the built-in HDD is 
  guaranteed. Do not embed a source code that plays back other types of 
  MP4 file in the application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libdbgrsx
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 280.001)
- (B#68682)
  When the debug cursor is displayed and ended without calling 
  cellDbgRsxDisableCursor(), the cursor remains displayed.

(Added to Release 280.001)
- A correct value cannot be obtained for the following bundle states:
  CELL_DBG_RSX_GRAPHICS_BUNDLE_STATE_ID_SURFACE_COLOR_TARGET
  CELL_DBG_RSX_GRAPHICS_BUNDLE_STATE_ID_POLYGON_STIPPLE_PATTERN

(Added to Release 280.001)
- For the bundle state CELL_DBG_RSX_GRAPHICS_BUNDLE_STATE_ID_COLOR_MASK, 
  not only a value of cellGcmSetColorMask but also of cellGcmSetColorMaskMrt 
  is obtained. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Custom Theme
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the effect sound data is too long, the sound may be interrupted 
  at a specific stage. Please refer to the "Custom Theme Specifications" 
  document for more details.

- In SDK280, since the theme file that contains RAF(Rich Appearance Format) 
  is a beta version, it can be used only on the Reference Tool and 
  the system software of the Debugging Station.
  Since it does not work on the system software of PLAYSTATION(R)3 , 
  if you want to confirm the combination with all the icons, please wait 
  until it is officially released.

Notes:
- The [BD/DVD Settings] menu in the [Settings] column has been renamed 
  to [Video Settings] menu in the system software 250 and later. 
  However, the icon ID that is used within the theme compiler should be 
  specified with "icon_bdvd_setting" as before.

- When a background in the RAF format is applied and the Internet browser 
  is activated, the standard background is displayed for a moment. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libftp
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Transfer speeds start to slow significantly once more than two
  simultaneous transfer streams are employed.

- It may fail to make a connection with Internet Explorer 6.0.

- Passive transfer mode (PASV) is currently not supported.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmic
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The maximum buffer size is better to be 128msec for each microphone.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfont
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The vertical rendering function does not support the Chinese character
  positioning.
  Also, it does not replace the 2-byte () and {} into the vertical
  character codes when vertical character displacement is performed
  internally.
  To avoid this problem, directly specify the vertical character codes
  or use the single-byte () and {}.

- The function for vertical writing does not support the proportional
  vertical writing layout.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfs
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- As a part of the reduction in the memory usage of the system software
  in SDK220, the amount of memory that is used by the file system by
  default has been reduced.
  Due to this change, the performance may be degraded slightly as
  compared to SDK21x when data is written and read in finer units (16KB
  or less). Also, when multiple file accesses are made from multiple
  threads at the same time, the request processing time may slightly
  increase.
  Adding memory from the application using cellFsSetIoBuffer() or other 
  APIs that are newly added could improve but also degrade the performance.
  Be sure to check the performance before you introduce the method.

- When the number of files to open at the same
  time in the CFS(SYS_DEV_HDD0) exceeds the upper limit, an error is
  returned from SDK220 onwards.
  Please be noted that when you update SDK21x to SDK220, an error that
  was not returned previously may be observed.

- (B#47766)
  A bug has been found that blocks the file operation permanently
  after you specify 0 for the file size at calling cellFsTruncate()
  or cellFsFtruncate() for the /dev_hdd0.
  (TechnoteID:200804-07 https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/716)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
dt Command
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When boot=dbg is set using a dtcparam that is provided in SDK192 or
  before and the boot parameter is displayed using the dtcparam command
  in SDK200 or later, boot=unknown is displayed. Reset boot=dbg using the
  dtcparam command in SDK200 or later.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BD Emulator
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The read time may differ from the actual drive depending on 
  the access pattern of the Blu-ray Disc drive. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
DECI3 CTRLP
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Because the ProDG Target Manager for PLAYSTATION(R)3 of v250.1 or 
  later uses CTRLP to establish a connection, when the ProDG 
  Target Manager for PLAYSTATION(R)3 is connected with a target, 
  the cell\host-common\samples\ctrlp sample program does not work. 
  When the sample program is started up, it shows "dt_register error" 
  and is terminated. 

  To run the ctrlp sample, disconnect the ProDG Target Manager 
  for PLAYSTATION(R)3.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cell OS Lv-2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The PPU program whose stack size is set to 4KB by
  SYS_PROCESS_PARAM can not be executed because a DSI occurs before
  the main function is called.

  [Workaround]
  Please set the stack size of a Primary PPU Thread to 8 KB or more.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard C/C++ Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<SPU>
- (B#20077) 
  When the new_handler is not set in the C++ library, and failed to allocate
  memory using "new", it enters into the infinite loop.

- If the following compile options are specified when compiling
  a program on the PPU side, many warnings may be output.

  -Wall -Wundef -Wundef -Wsystem-headers -Wcast-qual

- When including the system header, include it outside extern "C" or
  extern "C++".

  For example, an error may occur if a program such as below is compiled:

    extern "C" {
      ...

      #include <yyyy> // NG : Including within extern "C".

      ...
    }

  The error can be avoided by rewriting the program as shown below:

    #include <yyyy>
    extern "C" {

      ... 

    }

<PPU>
- When starting up a program in which <iostream> is included, the constructor
  of iostream will call the new operator. When you want to avoid calling
  "new" before executing the main function, do not use iostream.

(Added to Release 280.001)
<PPU>
- (B#16130)
  When the ios_base class or a derived class(fstream, iostream,
  stringstream, strstream, etc.) is used in the PRX, a DSI(data 
  storage interrupt) may occur in the _Fac_tidy() function when 
  the PPU program is ended.
  To avoid this problem, perform either of the followings:
    * Statically link libstdc++.a to the PRX
    * Generate an object in the ELF and pass the pointer to it to the PRX 
  Note that <iostream> cannot be used in the PRX.

(Modified at Release 280.001)
<PPU>
- (B#69368)
  The assert() macro in stdlib.h has a problem, which includes a null 
  character in the string of the call stack information printed to the TTY 
  before the process termination.
  If, for example, one of the following tools is used, the call stack 
  information may not be printed correctly.
   ProDG Target Manager for PLAYSTATION(R)3
   ProDG Debugger for PLAYSTATION(R)3
   Tuner for PLAYSTATION(R)3
  To avoid the issue, if e.g. Target Manager is used, please set "Unknown ESC" 
  to "Hide" in TTY channel shortcut menu.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfios
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- To use Edge Zlib or Edge LZMA, you must download and install
  PLAYSTATION(R)Edge 1.0.0.

- Regardless of whether you are using NPDRM files or not, you must link with
  libsysutil_np_stub.a.

- When scheduler::readDirectory() is called for the directory that is
  being redirected through an overlay, the redirection is not reflected
  and FIOS attempts to read the directory entry in the original
  directory.

- When creating an archive file, if the file to be archived has the
  same name as the output file, and the -y or -overwrite option is
  specified, the file to be archived is overwritten, and thus becomes
  unrecoverable.

(Added to Release 280.001)
- The psarc tool does not currently align encrypted files within PSARC-MSELF
  archives at optimal offsets. This can result in slightly reduced
  performance. A future version of the tool will fix the problem.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- cellGcmSetZcull() cannot set the unbind feature for the Zcull area.
  To set the unbind feature for the Zcull area, use cellGcmUnbindZcull().

- When the tile setting is made for the overlapping areas in RSX(TM) using
  cellGcmSetTile(), the address conversion feature of RSX(TM) will not work
  correctly.

  Accordingly, new functions cellGcmSetTileInfo() and cellGcmBindTile()
  have been added to check whether the tile areas are overlapping.

  Please use cellGcmSetTileInfo(), cellGcmBindTile() and cellGcmUnbindTile()
  instead of cellGcmSetTile() and cellGcmSetInvalidateTile() for future
  development.
  cellGcmSetTile() and cellGcmSetInvalidateTile() will be removed in the
  future release.

- When debug versions of cellGcmSetSurface() and cellGcmSetSurfaceWindow() 
  are used, assertion may be incorrectly raised inside each function. 
  (TechnoteID:200807-25  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/777)

- In gcm samples, we have found an error setting of cellGcmSetViewport().
  However, this does not affect the behavior of the samples.
  (TechnoteID:200808-06  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/785)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Toolchain / SPASM
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 280.001)
- (B#62636)
  No warnings are output when a macro is invoked with the wrong number of 
  arguments.
  Behavior is undefined.

(Added to Release 280.001)
- (B#62638)
  Branch hints get scheduled too early to assemble.  It is possible for 
  this case to occur with large programs.  The case can be improved by using 
  the "-Or" (optimize registers) command line option.

(Added to Release 280.001)
- (B#71003)
  SPASM does not warn/error when comments are nested.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmstream
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The maximum size of a single DSP page is limited to 12 KB.
  When using a custom DSP effect, the file size must not exceed 12KB.
  Note that the maximum size of a single DSP page is defined by 
  CELL_MS_DSP_PAGESIZE in mstream.h. 

- cellMSSystemConfigureSysUtil() is to be deleted in the future.
  Please migrate to cellMSSystemConfigureSysUtilEx(), that has been added
  to SDK200.002, in the game application.

- In Time Domain only mode, ADPCM data at low sample rates (< 24khz)
  can cause noise.

- When each sample is compiled using the SNC compiler, the sample data may not
  be loaded correctly because the environment variable CELL_SDK is used in
  the sample data path.
  When the CELL_SDK is defined with a path other than "usr\local\cell",
  it is required to alter the SAMPLE_CELL_SDK path in the sample source
  according to the environment.
  This problem does not occur when the GCC compiler is used.

- The DSP effects .pic files can be found under 
  cell\samples\sdk\sound\multistream\dspeffects\. However, for your
  convenience, please find the PPU converted object files (*.ppu.o), 
  located under cell\target\ppu\lib\pic\multistream\.
