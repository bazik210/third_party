----------------------------------------------------------------------
- For the following restriction in SDK270, the set brightness is now 
  reflected correctly.

  - When a background in the RAF format is applied and 
    [Settings] column -> [Theme Settings] -> [Background] -> [Brightness] is 
    set to a value other than "Normal", the background may be displayed with 
    the standard brightness for a moment when terminating some applications 
    such as the video.

- When XML that refers to a specific JPEG file is passed as an input while 
  performing a RAF compilation, it could hand up. This problem has been 
  fixed.

- The following problems have been fixed.

  - (B#69612)
    When a task that is created by calling cellSpursCreateTaskset2() is 
    deleted using  cellSpursDestroyTaskset2(), an internal resource leak 
    occurs.

  - (B#68316)
    cellSpursCreateTask(), cellSpursTaskAttributeInitialize(),
    The buffer for the task context that is specified by 
    cellSpursCreateTask2() has to be 128 byte aligned. However, the current 
    implementation checks only for the 16 byte alignment. 

<libspurs Job Queue>
- (B#70531)
  When multiple SPUs were executed in the SPURS job queue, the read only data 
  could not be flushed although the FLUSH command was executed. This problem 
  has been fixed.

  cellSpursJobQueueSetWaitingMode() was not updated correctly and entered into 
  the infinite loop. This problem has been fixed.

- (B#72130)
  In the SPURS job queue, while a job was running and when another job was 
  input into the empty command queue, other available SPU was not allocated 
  to execute the input job until the running job was completed. This problem 
  has been fixed.

- (B#72234)
  In the SPURS job queue, when a value other than multiples of 16 was 
  specified as a depth of the command queue, the behavior became indeterminate.   This problem has been fixed.

- The following problem has been fixed:

C/C++ Standard Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<PPU>
- (B#67212)
  When libstdc++_libent.o was linked with the program that redefine 
  operator new[], it was reported that operator new[] was multiply-defined. 
  This problem has been fixed.

<PPU>
- (B#63770)
  - The following bug has been fixed.

    - When using libcs.a and specifying a value more than 2GB (0x80000000)
      to the third argument "n" for the following functions, the calculation
      is not made correctly.
       - memcmp
       - strncasecmp
       - strncmp
       - strncat

<PPU>
- (B#67636)
  - When using libcs.a, strncasecmp() might not treat the third argument "n"
    correctly as the number of elements to compare.
    To be more precise, it was possible that a correct return value was not
    returned because of the following defects:

     When specifying a value less than 256 to "n":
      - The function compares two strings upto the (n+1)th elements, or
      - The function returns before the nth elements are not compared.

     When specifying a value of 256 or more to "n":
      - The function compares two strings over nth elements (At worst,
        like strcasecmp(), the function compares two strings until it
        finds elements that are not equal), or
      - The function returns before the first n elements of the two
        strings are compared, despite it does not find different
        elements.

    This problem has been fixed.

<PPU>
- (B#67741)
  The size of some function symbol in libcs.a was not set.
  This problem has been fixed.

<PPU/SPU>
- (B#67885)
  When the conversion specifier %[ was used with the following functions, 
  a wrong value may be returned. This problem has been fixed:
  fscanf, scanf, sscanf, vfscanf, vscanf, vsscanf

<PPU/SPU>
- (B#67886)
  The following functions could not perform a floating point 
  conversion for a string such as " 1.24E " correctly. This problem has 
  been fixed:
  fscanf, scanf, sscanf, vfscanf, vscanf, vsscanf
  fwscanf, wscanf, swscanf, vfwscanf, vwscanf, vswscanf

<SPU>
- (B#2759)
  When SIZE_MAX was passed to the strncmp function as the number of elements,
  it did not work correctly. This problem has been fixed.

<PPU>
- (B#68181)
  malloc_usable_size() might return a value 4 bytes smaller than
  the size allocated. This problem has been fixed.

<PPU>
- (B#71553)
  On the formatted output like printf and so on, the print conversion
  for denormalized numbers of the double precision type might not be done
  correctly. This problem has been fixed.
  To be more precise, this problem occurred when using conversion
  specifiers %a, %A, %e, %E, %f, %F, %g and %G.

<PPU>
- (B#68670)
  When a read from the SPU local storage was failed within the PPU 
  program that handles the SPU spu_printf calls, the PPU entered 
  into an infinite loop. This problem has been fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfios
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The following bugs were fixed:

  - Signed or encrypted files that are redirected by cell::fios::overlay 
    fail to load.
    (TechnoteID:200904-12 https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/902)

  - In SDK 270, the media call back for Blu-ray disc ejection was modified, but
    the libfios Overview was not updated. As of SDK 270, a media callback is no
    longer required to avoid retries after a Blu-ray disc is ejected. On
    ejection of a disc, the default callback now cancels all outstanding IO to
    the disc, and pending IO will no longer wait for reinsertion of the disc.

  - scheduler::closeAllFiles() was added to SDK 270, but the libfios Reference
    was not updated. This API can be used to close all open files, for example,
    after a Blu-ray disc is ejected.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- (B#72141)
  In the basic and the flip_immediate samples, the following problem
  has been fixed:
  - The alignment of the color buffer and the depth buffer is not correct.

- (B#69527)
  In the common\gcmutil sample, the following problem has been fixed:
  - When using cellGcmUtilCreateDepthTexture(), the Tile address of 
    DepthBuffer is specified overlapping the tile area of the color.

- (B#62676)
  In the fw sample, the following problem has been fixed:
  - When calling FWCellGCMWindow::destroy(), the object in use is deleted 
    before the callback function is deleted.

- The following problem has been fixed:

  (B#72115)
  - Bug in the SPU version of cellGcmCgStripBranchesFromFragmentUCode().
    (TechnoteID:200905-06  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/911)

- The following problem has been fixed:

  (B#71275)
  - When a game application calls cellGcmMapEaIoAddress() or 
    cellGcmMapEaIoAddressWithFlags() to map the effective address space 
    to the IO address space, if the last 1MB of the IO address space is 
    included in the mapping target, the function call ends in error and 
    CELL_GCM_ERROR_FAILURE is returned.
    (TechnoteID:200904-14  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/904)

- (B#45828)
  Since cellGcmReserveMethodSize() is no use for an unsafe mode function,
  cellGcmReserveMethodSizeUnsafe() and cellGcmReserveMethodSizeMeasure()
  have been deleted from the library.

- (B#36909)
  When cellGcmResetDefaultCommandBuffer() is called, 
  cellGcmSetDefaultFifoSize() is now automatically called to initialize the 
  default command buffer context structure gCellGcmCurrentContext.

- (B#70449,B#70446,B#70447,B#70448,B#70453)
  Error determination has been added for when the debug version of gcm is 
  in use.

- (B#71547)
  In libcgutil, when cellGcmCgSetInstructionSlot is 511 or more, it now 
  returns CELL_GCM_ERROR_FAILURE.

- (B#71700)
  When it is Graphics Error 3, it now displays an appropriate error message.

- The following problem has been fixed:

  (B#65293)
  - When cellGcmInitSystemMode() is called with 
    CELL_GCM_SYSTEM_MODE_IOMAP_512MB specified to the argument "mode", 
    the IO address space cannot be extended to 512MB.
    (TechnoteID:200906-02  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/919)

- (B#62122)
  In cellGcmInitDefaultFifoMode(), when the default command buffer mode was
  changed to either CELL_GCM_DEFAULT_FIFO_MODE_OPTIMIZE or 
  CELL_GCM_DEFAULT_FIFO_MODE_CONDITIONAL and the number of segments of the 
  command buffer was 2, it hung up. This problem has been fixed.
  Also, when a value less than 2 segments is specified to the command buffer 
  size by using cellGcmInit(), it now returns a CELL_GCM_ERROR_FAILURE error.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libresc
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In all libresc samples, the initialization procedure of libresc has 
  been corrected.
  It has been changed to set the CellRescDsts structure to all 
  resolutions of CellRescInitConfig.supportModes that is set by using 
  cellRescInit().
  Due to this change, the color buffer size that is obtained by 
  cellRescGetBufferSize() will be a correct value.

- When CELL_RESC_CONSTANT_VRAM was running, the value that was returned 
  to the third argument of 

  cellRescGetBufferSize(int32_t* const colorBuffers, int32_t* const 
  vertexArray,  int32_t* const fragmentShader);

  depended on the video output resolution unexpectedly. This problem has 
  been fixed.
  From this version onward, a certain value (0x300) will be always returned.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
PLAYSTATION(R)3 Sample Browser 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- (B#71790)
  When a search by a function name was conducted, only up to 30 results 
  were returned. This problem has been fixed.
  From this version onward, all results will be displayed.

- (B#71815)
  When a search by a function name cellSpursJobChainAttributeInitialize
  is conducted, no result was returned. This problem has been fixed.

- (B#71805)
  The start up time when the Sample Browser(PS3SampleBrowser.exe) is 
  started up for the first time has been improved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmstream
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- (B#71206)
  The Feedback Delay Network Reverb (Slot A) (mstream_fdn_reverb_slot_a.pic) 
  has had its efficiency improved.

- (B#67422)
  The cellMSCoreSetDSP function didnt check for the CELL_MS_DSPALLSLOTS 
  flag even though the documentation described it as supported. 
  The documentation has been updated and the function now sets an error 
  if this flag is specified.

- (B#69384)
  A rare race condition could occur that caused stream types to become 
  confused. This problem has been fixed.

- (B#70103)
  When adding a named object by calling cellMSSulphaNameObject(), Sulpha 
  always returned NOFREESTREAMS. This problem has been fixed.

- (B#71200)
  When passing NULL to cellMSSulphaAdd3dShape an exception occured. 
  This problem has been fixed.

- (B#71895)
  The auxiliary send dsp effect (mstream_dsp_aux_send.pic / 
  mstream_dsp_aux_send.ppu.o) contained debug printf's that would fill 
  the TTY output when pausing the bus or stream it was attached to. 
  This has now been resolved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libscream
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- (B#67952)
  When building the scream_routing sample with a build configuration of 
  SNC Debug or SNC Release, an .elf file was built but no .self was created. 
  This problem has been fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Toolchain / SPASM
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- (B#60823)
  ".assignreg out" directive was not working as documented.
  This bug has been fixed.

- (B#62454)
  The "--rept" and "--endrept" preprocessor directives did not work as defined 
  in the user manual.
  This bug has been fixed.

- (B#62686)

  - (B#31250)
    Assignment of TEXUNIT4 was wrapping around to TEXUNIT0 without error
    or warning.

  - (B#42758)
    Cg Compiler's internal register allocation was causing warnings 
    like the following:

      shader.cg(lineXXX) : warning C7050: "$tempYYYY" might be used 
      before being initialized

----------------------------------------------------------------------
PSGL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The following problem has been fixed:
  PSGL now properly keeps memory allocations pinned 
  when they are mapped using glMapBuffer.

  - (B#70439)
    Textures can be corrupted due to data being reallocated by the PSGL
    memory manager. 

- The following problem has been fixed:

  - (B#70920)
    psgl_shader_builder provided for generation of shaders.bin,
    shader set used by PSGL fixed function shading pipeline, 
    was not generating correct shaders for GL_FOG to properly clamp.
