======================================================================
The following are known bugs, limitations and cautions on 
the Reference Tool SDK package.

New updates have the release version of this package. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reference Tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- A problem has been found that when a program that outputs voice 
  from RSX(TM) is activated, and then one of the following is 
  performed, voice is not output.
  - Plug-in/out the HDMI cable
  - Switch the TV monitor power from Off to On (including the AV Amp)
  - Switch between the TV monitor channels and set the HDMI input again
    (including the AV Amp)

- The following devices are not supported now.

  - CompactFlash(R)
  - SD Memory Card
  - FOOT SW

  The wireless feature (Bluetooth(R)/Wireless LAN) can only be used 
  on Reference Tools DEH-R1040 and later, which have the necessary 
  authorization tools.
  The antenna for the wireless feature is bundled with DEH-1040 and 
  later Reference Tools. Do not attempt to connect DEH-R1030 and 
  earlier Reference Tools.

- For specifications regarding the Reference Tool, please refer to 
  info/Reference_System-Supplement_*.pdf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
CBE Specifications
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Currently, the CBE that is equipped with each tool version can use 
  six SPUs. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Software(GUI) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Since a change has been made so that a process termination wait occurs 
  when the power off processing is performed in the case of when booted 
  from the debugger, with some of the samples that do not support 
  the termination processing of game applications, a timeout occurs 
  and the system is forcibly terminated with a warning sound when 
  the power off processing is performed in the case of when booted from 
  the debugger. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Utilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Web Browser Utility>
- Files cannot be downloaded with the downloader. 

<On-Screen Keyboard Utility>
- The optional dictionary feature is not supported. 

< Content Search Utility >
(Added in Version 190.002)
- When file paths to the still image and animation thumbnails of content 
  are created using cellSearchPrepareFile() and the thumbnails are changed 
  from the system software, the changes will not be reflected unless 
  cellSearchPrepareFile() is executed again. 

<Save Data Utility>
(Added in Version 190.002)
- There is a restriction on the string that is displayed next to 
  the thumbnail of the save data listed using cellSaveDataListDelete(). 

  When a value is specified to dirNamePrefix as shown below, it should 
  behave correctly, however, it is always displayed as "Title" in SDK 190: 

     - When "*" is specified, "Title" is displayed. 
     - When other than "*" is specified, "Subtitle" is displayed. 

  This problem will be fixed in the future SDK. 

(Added in Version 190.002)
- Once the data is deleted using cellSaveDataListDelete(),the button navigation
   "Enter" at the bottom of the screen will disappear. 
  This problem will be fixed in the future SDK. 

(Added in Version 190.002)
- Once the data is copied using cellSaveDataListImport(),the button navigation 
  "Enter" at the bottom of the screen will disappear. 
  This problem will be fixed in the future SDK. 

< Video Utility >
(Added in Version 190.002)
- After exporting a file using the video utility, if the directory where 
  the exported file is stored becomes empty, the directory will be deleted. 

< Audio Setting Utility >
(Added in Version 190.002)
- cellAudioInGetAvailableDeviceInfo() does not support devices such as 
  EyeToy USB Camera(for PlayStation 2)/PLAYSTATION(R)Eye. 
  Those devices will be supported in the future release.

(Added in Version 190.002)
- In multi microphone mode, an USB device is registered into the system 
  software by calling cellAudioInRegisterDevice() with the type of the device 
  specified to its argument.
  After the registration processing, when the system software detects a device 
  that has the same type as the registered device, it automatically enables 
  the device and allocates a device number.
  Accordingly, when multiple devices that have the same type as the device 
  that the application uses are connected to PS3, it automatically detects and 
  enables all the devices. Therefore, it is not possible to enable only 
  a single device at the moment. A method to support such feature will be 
  considered in the feature version upgrade.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BD Emulator (HDD)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When using the BD emulator on Windows, dtcfsutil.exe does not operate 
  on the msys. Please use dtcfsutil.exe on the command prompt. 
  There is no problem when using the BD emulator on Linux.
  Also note that the above restriction is applied when formatting the 
  HDD format for the BD emulator.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
File System
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<cellftp>
- The -u option of the put command does not work correctly.

- Although the option -u of the copy command or the copydir command 
  is specified, it does not work correctly if the copy destination is HOSTFS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libftp
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Transfer speeds start to slow significantly once more than two
  simultaneous transfer streams are employed.

- It may fail to make a connection with Internet Explorer 6.0.

- Passive transfer mode (PASV) is currently not supported.

- Rename commands (RNFR/RNTO) are currently not supported.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cell OS Lv-2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- If you try to create upper limit or more memory containers with 
  sys_memory_container_create(), an ID that is the same as that of 
  the memory container that has already been allocated is returned 
  for a new memory container. When this occurs, the older memory 
  container may not be destroyed with sys_memory_container_destroy() 
  and may not be retrieved by the system even at the time of game 
  process termination. 

  [Workaround]
  Please make sure that the number of memory containers to be created 
  with a game process at the same time is less than 10. 

(Added in Version 190.002)
- There is following limitation.

  - From SDK190 onwards, the PPU program whose stack size is set to 4KB by 
    SYS_PROCESS_PARAM SDK190 can not be executed because a DSI occurs before
    the main function is called. 

    From SDK190 onwards, please set the stack size to 8 KB or more.

(Added in Version 190.002)
- The performance of the lightweight mutex (lwmutex) associated with 
  the lightweight condition variable (lwcond) may be degraded. 

  This problem occurs when a PPU thread that is executing sys_lwcond_wait() 
  does not exists when sys_lwcond_signal() is called. This will degrade 
  the performance of sys_lwmutex_lock()/unlock() that will be taken place 
  afterworlds.
  The performance degradation is observed in a sequence where no waiting 
  thread exists
  in lwmutex. Specifically, the performance will be degraded as shown below:

  In sys_lwmutex_lock() : Approximately from 0.17 usec to 1.9 usec
  In sys_lwmutex_unlock() : Approximately from 0.18 usec to 1.0 usec

  The workarounda is as shown below: 

  -  When there is 1 waiter thread 
     Use sys_lwcond_signal_all

  -  When multiple waiter threads exist 
     1) Execute sys_lwcond_signal() only when there is a thread waiting
     2) Use sys_lwcond_signal_to()

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfont
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The vertical rendering function does not support the Chinese character
  positioning.
  Also, it does not replace the 2-byte () and {} into the vertical 
  character codes when vertical character displacement is performed 
  internally.
  To avoid this problem, directly specify the vertical character codes 
  or use the single-byte () and {}.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard C/C++ Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- If the following compile options are specified when compiling 
  a program on the PPU side, many warnings may be output. 

  -Wall -Wundef -Wundef -Wsystem-headers -Wcast-qual

- When compiling an SPU program that included math.h, an error occurs 
  if -fsingle-precision-constant is specified as the compile option. 

- When including the system header, include it outside extern "C" or 
  extern "C++". 

  For example, an error may occur if a program such as below is compiled:

    extern "C" {
      ...

      #include <yyyy> // NG : Including within extern "C". 

      ...
    }

  The error can be avoided by rewriting the program as shown below: 

    #include <yyyy>
    extern "C" {

      ... 

    }

(Added in Version 190.002)
<PPU>
- When starting up a program in which <iostream> is included, the constructor 
  of iostream will call the new operator. When you want to avoid calling 
  "new" before executing the main function, do not use iostream.

<PPU>
- There are following limitations on the usage of atexit function.

  * If a function in a PRX module is registered using atexit function,
    and if main function finishes or exit function is invoked after the 
    PRX module is stopped, a DSI (data storage interrupt) will occur.

  * If atexit function is used in a C++ global constructor, the behavior 
    is different from the C++ standard.  All the registered functions are 
    invoked prior to all the global destructors.

<PPU>
- If you use class ios_base or any of its derived classes (fstream,
  iostream, stringstream, strstream, etc.) in PRX, create their 
  instances in ELF, and pass the pointers to them to PRX.  If they are 
  created in PRX, a DSI (data storage interrupt) may occur in function 
  _Fac_tidy() at the termination of the PPU program.

<SPU>
- If very large amount of stack or heap area is used, heap area may be 
  destroyed.  SPU ABI allows accessing memory at negative offsets from 
  stack pointer up to -2000 as well as positive offsets, but using 
  negative offsets is not guaranteed in some cases due to a bug.
  Negative offsets from stack pointer are used in spu_printf(), leaf 
  functions, etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Vector Math
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- A function of the Vector Math library, that calculates the square 
  root or the inverse number of the square root, does not meet the 
  operation accuracy of the IEEE float type standard.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libcamera
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When other USB devices are attached/detached, a few video frames 
  may be lost during the transition.

- Restrictions on the USB Video Class (UVC) Camera
  1. Does not support a UVC camera that is not compliant with the UVC 
     even though it is USB 2.0 compliant. 
  2. Does not support a camera that has no streaming function.
  3. Does not support a camera that is connected via the USB 1.1 hub.
  4. Does not support the mirror function. 
  5. Support only a single camera.
  6. EyeToy USB Camera(for PlayStation 2) is given a higher priority 
     when it is connected. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmic
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The system echo-canceller does not support USB loudspeaker. 
  Audio chat may suffer echo feedback or howling if chat outputs 
  to USB loudspeaker.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libusbd
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When connecting or disconnecting a device to a USB port of the 
  machine body, other USB devices already connected may be 
  disconnected or may have an impact on its data communication.
  To avoid these problems, connect a self power hub to one of the USB 
  ports of the machine body.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
MultiStream
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In Time Domain only mode, ADPCM data at low sample rates (< 24khz) 
  can cause noise

(Added in Version 190.002)
- When the sound output is set based on the system utility information 
  using cellMSSystemConfigureSysUtil(), it is not set correctly. 
  Check the available audio mode using cellAudioOutGetSoundAvailability(), 
  then change the sound output using cellAudioOutConfigure().

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libperf
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the Lv-2 system call trace is enabled with the back trace 
  on the program that is linked with libperf.a of SDK170 or before, 
  it does not work on the target system that is updated to SDK 180 and later.
  (applicable to libperf/ppu sample)
  Please use libperf.a that is released after SDK 180.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SPU Runtime Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<libspurs task>
(Added in Version 190.002)
- When the SPURS task calls the synchronization object and the following 
  conditions are met, an undefined behavior may be observed:

  - Conditions for entering into the WAIT state are met.
  - The context storage space is set but the LS pattern is not included 
    in the stack area.

  When the above conditions are met, CELL_SPURS_TASK_ERROR_STAT is returned 
  and the state of the synchronization object is corrupted. As a result, 
  when this synchronization object is called afterwards the behavior 
  will be undefined. 
  Also, if the caller SPURS task calls an interface that enters into 
  the WAIT state after receiving this error, the behavior will be undefined. 

<libspurs job>
(Added in Version 190.002)
- When cellSpursRunJobChain() is executed, more SPUs than the Ready 
  Count may temporarily execute a job incorrectly. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added in Version 190.002)
- When the tile setting is made for the overlapping areas in RSX(TM) using 
  cellGcmSetTile(), the address conversion feature of RSX(TM) will not work 
  correctly. 

  Accordingly, new functions cellGcmSetTileInfo() and cellGcmBindTile() 
  have been added to check whether the tile areas are overlapping. 

  Please use cellGcmSetTileInfo(), cellGcmBindTile() and cellGcmUnbindTile() 
  instead of cellGcmSetTile() and cellGcmSetInvalidateTile() for future 
  development. 
  cellGcmSetTile() and cellGcmSetInvalidateTile() will be removed in the 
  future release. 

(Added in Version 190.002)
- In the 10th argument sFunc of cellGcmSetZcull(), the constants such as 
  CELL_GCM_ALWAYS and CELL_GCM_LESS were available. However, since this is not 
  a correct way to call them, it is now treated as an error when they are 
  used in the new function cellGcmBindZcull(). Instead, 
  use CELL_GCM_SCULL_SFUNC_ALWAYS and CELL_GCM_SCULL_SFUNC_LESS. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm_tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The windows version of libgcm_tool is available only with VisualStudio2005. 
  Also note that the sample project file is created using VisualStudio2005.
  Both the library and the sample are not compliant with VisualStudio2003.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libsail
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The user defined resource feature is currently handled as 
  a beta version. 
  When submitting a master disc using this user defined source feature, 
  please make sure to switch to libsail that includes the official version. 

(Added in Version 190.002)
- Only the playback of a MP4 file that is created by the recording utility 
  and is placed on the built-in HDD is guaranteed. Do not embed a source code 
  that plays back other types of MP4 file in the application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Commerce
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- sceNpCommerceGetProductCategoryStart() does not behave correctly when 
  CELL_SYSUTIL_LANG_CHINESE_T is specified to the 3rd argument "lang_code". 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Matching
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added in Version 190.002)
- The return value of the NP matching API may be more than 0 
  in a successful case: 
  This pehenomenon occurs in the following 2 APIs: 
    - sceNpMatchingGetResult()
    - sceNpMatchingGetRoomMemberListLocal()

  This problem occurs when other than NULL is set to the argument buf 
  of the above APIs and the resulting data size obtained when they are 
  executed is more than 0.
