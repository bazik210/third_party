======================================================================
The following are known bugs, limitations and cautions on 
the Reference Tool SDK package.

New updates have the release version of this package. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reference Tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- A problem has been found that when a program that outputs voice 
  from RSX(TM) is activated, and then one of the following is 
  performed, voice is not output.
  - Plug-in/out the HDMI cable
  - Switch the TV monitor power from Off to On (including the AV Amp)
  - Switch between the TV monitor channels and set the HDMI input again
    (including the AV Amp)

- The following devices are not supported now.

  - CompactFlash(R)
  - SD Memory Card

- For specifications regarding the Reference Tool, please refer to 
  SDK_doc/jp(en)/pdf/development_basic/Reference_System-Supplement_*.pdf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
CBE Specifications
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Currently, the CBE that is equipped with each tool version can use 
  six SPUs. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libdbg
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 220.002)
- The following functions are no longer supported from this SDK version:

   - cellDbgRawSpuInitialize()
   - cellDbgRawSpuHandleInterrupt()
   - cellDbgRawSpuSetRunControl()
   - cellDbgRawSpuLockExecutionControl()
   - cellDbgRawSpuUnlockExecutionControl()

  These functions will be obsoleted from the future SDKs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Software
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 220.002)
- Validation of a media or the file system itself cannot be performed 
  from the Check menu in the Game column.

  When submitting a master disc, make sure to verify the disc that no error 
  is present using the Disc Image Generator for PLAYSTATION(R)3 or 
  the Disc Image Checker for PLAYSTATION(R)3.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Utilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
< SubDisplay Utility>
- (B#41848)
  To use the subdisplay utility, the PSP(TM) system software version 3.72
  or later is required.

(Added to Release 220.002)
- (B#49155) 
  When cellSubdisplay() is called at the same time as the wired LAN is 
  initialized(the interface is started), it may fail to call the function. 

< Access Point Utility >
(Updated in Release 220.002)
- To check the connection with PSP(TM), a ps3scan utility that is to be 
  released from PSP(TM) SDK3.80 is required.

< Remote Play Utility >
- (B#41848)
  To perform remote play with the PLAYSTATION(R)3 system software version 
  2.00, PSP(TM) system software version 3.72 or later is required.

< Content Search Utility >
- When file paths to the still image and animation thumbnails of content 
  are created using cellSearchPrepareFile() and the thumbnails are changed 
  from the system software, the changes will not be reflected unless 
  cellSearchPrepareFile() is executed again. 

<On-Screen Keyboard Utility>
- The optional dictionary feature is not supported. 

< Message Dialog Utility >
- (B#42912)
  When a string, that is passed to the argument of cellMsgDialogOpen2(), 
  is other than the UTF-8, it ends normally where an error should have 
  been returned.
  Also the string that is passed to the argument is not displayed. 
  Instead, the following message dialog is displayed:

    "An error occurred.
      (8002B301)"

  Note that (8002B301) in the above dialog is displayed as (FFFFFFFF) in 
  SDK 200 or before.

< Audio Setting Utility >
- cellAudioInGetAvailableDeviceInfo() does not support devices such as 
  EyeToy USB Camera(for PlayStation 2)/PLAYSTATION(R)Eye. 
  Those devices will be supported in the future release.

- In the multi microphone mode, cellAudioInRegisterDevice() is executed with 
  an audio input device type preferred by the application specified to the 
  argument deviceType in order to resister the audio input device into 
  the system.
  When cellAudioInRegisterDevice() is called, the system software 
  automatically assign a device number regardless of whether a matching audio 
  input device is found or not. Whether the audio input device that has the 
  device number is available or not can be checked through polling using 
  cellMicIsAttached() of libmic or an event notification from libmic. 

  Since a device number is automatically assigned as described above, 
  when multiple USB devices(audio input device) of the type that the game 
  application prefers are connected to PLAYSTATION(R)3, which device being 
  connected to a USB port has which device number cannot be uniquely identified.
  In such case, a user interface should be implemented to identify it such as 
  by displaying an indicator (volume) or the like on the screen.
  Note that a mechanism that can explicitly assign a device number to 
  a specific device will be provided in the future release.

< Video Configuration Utility >
- When calling cellVideoOutSetGamma() at certain timings, 
  the mute setting of the application's video output is not disabled and 
  the screen continues to remain in the blackout state.

(Added to Release 220.002)
- With SDK210 or before, the resolutions such as 960x1080/1280x1080/1440x1080/
  1600x1080 were not available when the resolution of the movie output is set 
  to WUXGA in the development environment, however this limitation has been 
  removed.

< Music Utility >
(Added to Release 220.002)
- When the execution of cellMusicSetPlaybackCommand() terminates normally,
  the callback function [specified in the fourth argument, func, 
  of cellMusicInitialize()] is not called as it should be.
  This bug does not occur with cellMusicSetPlaybackCommand2().
  (TechnoteID:200803-08  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/701)

(Added to Release 220.002)
- With the playback feature that does not use the memory container, when 
  all songs are repeated and the shuffle is set to ON, the last song 
  cannot be skipped (Next) and fast-rewinding to the previous song is not 
  possible with the first song, and then it stops playing. This problem 
  will be fixed in SDK 240.

< Game Update Utility >
-  When the Reference Tool is booted having "Debugger mode" specified to 
   "Boot parameters" using the Administration Tool or the like, 
   the patch distribution feature of the Game Update utility cannot be 
   utilized.

< Web Browser Utility>
- Files cannot be downloaded with the downloader. 

- The handler onMouseOver/onMouseOut of JavaScript does not work 
  properly. Use onFocus/onBlur instead.

- The performance may be slow when using ClickableMap.

< Background Download utility >
(Added to Release 220.002)
- The following is a notice regarding the behavior of background downloads when
  they are performed while a game application is running.

  Although a background download will usually continue while a game 
  application is running, it will be stopped by any one of the following 
  conditions.

    - The game application has created more than one socket
    - There is more than one connection that uses the NP signaling utility
    - The AV chat utility or the AV chat 2 utility is being used

  The background download will resume once the condition that stopped it 
  no longer applies. 
  Please do not create a game application that is dependent on the progress of
  background downloads. 

  If new conditions are added to the above list of conditions that stop 
  background downloads given the addition of a new utility, or if there are 
  any changes regarding this issue, it will be announced in this technote.
  (TechnoteID:200803-15  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/708)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cell OS Lv-2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- If you try to create upper limit or more memory containers with 
  sys_memory_container_create(), an ID that is the same as that of 
  the memory container that has already been allocated is returned 
  for a new memory container. When this occurs, the older memory 
  container may not be destroyed with sys_memory_container_destroy() 
  and may not be retrieved by the system even at the time of game 
  process termination. 

  [Workaround]
  Please make sure that the number of memory containers to be created 
  with a game process at the same time is less than 10. 

- The PPU program whose stack size is set to 4KB by 
  SYS_PROCESS_PARAM can not be executed because a DSI occurs before
  the main function is called. 

  [Workaround]
  Please set the stack size of a Primary PPU Thread to 8 KB or more.

- (B#47188)
  When the game process is terminated without discarding the virtual 
  memory that is generated using sys_vm_memory_map(), the system may crash.

  [Workaround]
  Explicitly discard the virtual memory area that is generated using 
  sys_vm_memory() by calling sys_vm_unmap() before the game process is 
  terminated.

(Added to Release 220.002)
- When a memory straddling both a vertual memory area and an unmapped 
  area is passed to the system call, the kernel may get panicked. 

  [Workaround]
  When executing a system call that returns EFAULT, do not pass a 
  memory straddling both a virtual memory area and an unmapped area 
  in order to use it for exchanging a value between the user and the 
  kernel.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfont
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The vertical rendering function does not support the Chinese character
  positioning.
  Also, it does not replace the 2-byte () and {} into the vertical 
  character codes when vertical character displacement is performed 
  internally.
  To avoid this problem, directly specify the vertical character codes 
  or use the single-byte () and {}.

(Added to Release 220.002)
- The function for vertical writing does not support the proportional 
  vertical writing layout.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfs
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 220.002)
- As a part of the reduction in the memory usage of the system software
  in SDK220, the amount of memory that is used by the file system by 
  default has been reduced.
  Due to this change, the performance may be degraded slightly as 
  compared to SDK21x when data is written and read in finer units (16KB 
  or less). Also, when multiple file accesses are made from multiple 
  threads at the same time, the request processing time may slightly 
  increase.
  The performance can be increased by adding memory upon request of the 
  application using an API such as cellFsSetIoBuffer that is newly added.

(Added to Release 220.002)
- As noted as a bugfix item, when the number of files to open at the same 
  time in the CFS(SYS_DEV_HDD0) exceeds the upper limit, an error is 
  returned from SDK220 onwards.
  Please be noted that when you update SDK21x to SDK220, an error that 
  was not returned previously may be observed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
GTF
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 220.002)
- dds2gtf cannot convert the following input formats correctly.
  This problem will be fixed in the future release.
  - G8R8_G8R8, R8G8_B8G8
  - UYVY, YUY2
  - R16F

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libperf
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the Lv-2 system call trace is enabled with the back trace 
  on the program that is linked with libperf.a of SDK170 or before, 
  it does not work on the target system that is updated to SDK 180 and 
  later.
  (applicable to libperf/ppu sample)
  Please use libperf.a that is released after SDK 180.

(Updated in Release 220.002)
- (B#43808)
  The Tuner for PLAYSTATION(R)3 cannot be used to measure the performance 
  of the sample program of libperf because the measurement module on 
  the target is utilized.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libftp
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Transfer speeds start to slow significantly once more than two
  simultaneous transfer streams are employed.

- It may fail to make a connection with Internet Explorer 6.0.

- Passive transfer mode (PASV) is currently not supported.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libsail
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When playing back a PAMF file, few frames(1 to 3 frames) at the end of 
  a stream cannot be obtained.

- Only the playback of a MP4 file that is created by the recording utility 
  and is placed on the built-in HDD is guaranteed. Do not embed a source code 
  that plays back other types of MP4 file in the application.

(Added to Release 220.002)
- The AVI file does not support the index in the OpenDML(AVI2.0) format.
  It only supports the idx1 chunk format.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libusbd
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When connecting or disconnecting a device to a USB port of the 
  machine body, other USB devices already connected may be 
  disconnected or may have an impact on its data communication.
  To avoid these problems, connect a self power hub to one of the USB 
  ports of the machine body.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- cellGcmSetZcull() cannot set the unbind feature for the Zcull area. 
  To set the unbind feature for the Zcull area, use cellGcmUnbindZcull().

- When the tile setting is made for the overlapping areas in RSX(TM) using 
  cellGcmSetTile(), the address conversion feature of RSX(TM) will not work 
  correctly. 

  Accordingly, new functions cellGcmSetTileInfo() and cellGcmBindTile() 
  have been added to check whether the tile areas are overlapping. 

  Please use cellGcmSetTileInfo(), cellGcmBindTile() and cellGcmUnbindTile() 
  instead of cellGcmSetTile() and cellGcmSetInvalidateTile() for future 
  development. 
  cellGcmSetTile() and cellGcmSetInvalidateTile() will be removed in the 
  future release. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libcamera
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Restrictions on the USB Video Class (UVC) Camera
  1. Does not support a UVC camera that is not compliant with the UVC 
     even though it is USB 2.0 compliant. 
  2. Does not support a camera that has no streaming function.
  3. Does not support a camera that is connected via the USB 1.1 hub.
  4. Does not support the mirror function. 
  5. Support only a single camera.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libpad for Windows
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Only Windows XP is supported.
  Windows Vista will be supported in the future.

(Added to Release 220.002)
- The specification change of libpad (PLAYSTATION(R) 3 version) made 
  in SDK 220 is not supported. It will be supported in SDK 240.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
dt Command
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When boot=dbg is set using a dtcparam that is provided in SDK192 or 
  before and the boot parameter is displayed using the dtcparam command 
  in SDK200 or later, boot=unknown is displayed. Reset boot=dbg using the 
  dtcparam command in SDK200 or later.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sample Program(cell/samples)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 220.002)
- When the following samples are built using the SNC PPU Toolchain, 
  they do not behave correctly and a deadlock occurs. Note that a sample
  that is built using GCC411 runs normally.

  samples/tutorial/ParticleSimulator/07_spu_particles_spurs_task
  samples/tutorial/ParticleSimulator/08_spu_particles_gl_events

(Added to Release 220.002)
- When booting the self file of the following samples using 
  the Reference Tool in the debugger mode, confirm that the following 
  message is output to the TTY: 

  Samples:
    samples/sdk/network/np/np_game
    samples/sdk/sysutil/subdisplay/msgdialog
    samples/sdk/sysutil/avc2/voicechat

  Message:
   "*** network ready. myaddr: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX ***"
    (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX indicates the IP address of your PLAYSTATION(R)3.)

  When the self file is booted before the message is output, the samples 
  do not run correctly because it assumes that the network is not connected.

- When the program is to be built on Visual Studio 2005 because the 
  solution/project files of Visual Studio 2003 taht comes with the sample 
  have been converted into Visual Studio 2005 version, it is required to 
  set as follows:

  [Maximum number of parallel project builds] should be set with 1 from 
  [Tools] -> [Options] -> [Projects and Solutions] -> [Build and Run].
  When this maximum number is set with 2 or more, it may fail to build a 
  project.

- When the solution file that contains Framework.vcproj is converted 
  from VisualStudio2003 version into VisualStudio2005 version, a build 
  structure, which does not exist in the solution file of VisualStudio2003 
  version, is wrongly added.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmstream
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The *.pic file can be found under cell/samples/sdk/sound/multistream/
  dspeffectsm, however, use the PPU object file(*.ppu.o), that is located 
  under cell/target/spu/lib/pic/multistream, in the game application. 

- cellMSSystemConfigureSysUtil() is to be deleted in the future. 
  Please migrate to cellMSSystemConfigureSysUtilEx(), that has been added 
  to SDK200.002, in the game application. 

- In Time Domain only mode, ADPCM data at low sample rates (< 24khz) 
  can cause noise.

(Added to Release 220.002)
- When samples are compiled individually using the project file that is 
  contained in each sample, it is required to build dependencies among 
  the following samples.
  Please refer to readme_*.txt of each sample for more details.
  Note that when the whole samples are compiled using the project files 
  (samples.sln/samples-2005.sln) or the makefile contained immediately under 
  samples/sdk/sound/multistream, the dependencies can be ignored. 

  dsp_sample
  eq_sample
  rain_sample
  simple_created_td
  simple_created_fd

(Added to Release 220.002)
- When each sample is compiled using the SNC compiler, the sample data may not 
  be loaded correctly because the environment variable CELL_SDK is used in 
  the sample data path. 

  When the CELL_SDK is defined with a path other than "/usr/local/cell/", 
  it is required to alter the SAMPLE_CELL_SDK path in the sample source 
  according to the environment.

  This problem does not occur when the GCC compiler is used.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Control Console
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 220.002)
- The Control Console Client library is available only with 
  the Visual Studio 2005.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Matching2 Utility
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 220.002)
  When creating a room or joining a room in one of the NP matching 2 
  utility samples below, the On-Screen keyboard will be displayed 
  for entering the room password. A hang-up will occur if you attempt 
  to sign-out from the PLAYSTATION(R)Network while this on-screen keyboard 
  is displayed.

    np_matching2_allow_block_list
    np_matching2_group_room
    np_matching2_room_password
    np_matching2_slot_reservation
    np_matching2_team_id

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard C/C++ Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<SPU>
- (B#20077) 
  When the new_handler is not set in the C++ library, and failed to allocate 
  memory using "new", it enters into the infinite loop.

- If the following compile options are specified when compiling 
  a program on the PPU side, many warnings may be output. 

  -Wall -Wundef -Wundef -Wsystem-headers -Wcast-qual

- When compiling an SPU program that included math.h, an error occurs 
  if -fsingle-precision-constant is specified as the compile option. 

- When including the system header, include it outside extern "C" or 
  extern "C++". 

  For example, an error may occur if a program such as below is compiled:

    extern "C" {
      ...

      #include <yyyy> // NG : Including within extern "C". 

      ...
    }

  The error can be avoided by rewriting the program as shown below: 

    #include <yyyy>
    extern "C" {

      ... 

    }

<PPU>
- When starting up a program in which <iostream> is included, the constructor 
  of iostream will call the new operator. When you want to avoid calling 
  "new" before executing the main function, do not use iostream.

<PPU>
- There are following limitations on the usage of atexit function.

  * If atexit function is used in a C++ global constructor, the behavior 
    is different from the C++ standard.  All the registered functions are 
    invoked prior to all the global destructors.

<PPU>
- If you use class ios_base or any of its derived classes (fstream,
  iostream, stringstream, strstream, etc.) in PRX, create their 
  instances in ELF, and pass the pointers to them to PRX.  If they are 
  created in PRX, a DSI (data storage interrupt) may occur in function 
  _Fac_tidy() at the termination of the PPU program.

<SPU>
- If very large amount of stack or heap area is used, heap area may be 
  destroyed.  SPU ABI allows accessing memory at negative offsets from 
  stack pointer up to -2000 as well as positive offsets, but using 
  negative offsets is not guaranteed in some cases due to a bug.
  Negative offsets from stack pointer are used in spu_printf(), leaf 
  functions, etc.
