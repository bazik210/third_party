======================================================================
The following are known bugs, limitations and cautions on 
the Reference Tool SDK package.

New updates have the release version of this package. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reference Tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- For specifications regarding the Reference Tool, please refer to 
  SDK_doc\jp(en)\pdf\development_basic\Reference_System-Supplement_*.pdf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
CBE Specifications
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Currently, the CBE that is equipped with each tool version can use 
  six SPUs. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Software
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Check menu in the Game column>
- Validation of a media or the file system itself cannot be performed 
  from the Check menu in the Game column.

  When submitting a master disc, make sure to verify the disc that no error
  is present using the Disc Image Generator for PLAYSTATION(R)3 or
  the Disc Image Checker for PLAYSTATION(R)3.

- When performing the check from the Check menu in the Game column, 
  if the number of result files exceeds approximately 80 to 100 depending 
  on each check item, the file entries of the root directory in the USB 
  mass storage run out and the subsequent check result files may no 
  longer be stored.
  In such case, move the check result files to another directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Utilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<On-Screen Keyboard Utility>
- The optional dictionary feature is not supported.

(Added to Release 250.001)
- A game application may freeze when a word is forcibly entered or cancelled 
  from the game application using cellOskDialogExtSendFinishMessage(), 
  immediately after a function, registered with 
  cellOskDialogExtRegisterKeyboardEventHookCallback(), is called. 

(Added to Release 250.001)
- On Japanese input, if a word is divided up into multiple clauses during 
  conversion, and the user starts to input the next word, only the first 
  clause of the first word gets entered (the other clauses disappear).

<Remote Play Utility>
- PSP(TM) system software version 3.72 or later is required.

<Game Update Utility>
-  When the Reference Tool is booted having "Debugger mode" specified to
   "Boot parameters" using the Administration Tool or the like,
   the patch distribution feature of the Game Update utility cannot be
   utilized.

<Audio Configuration Utility>
- In the multi microphone mode, cellAudioInRegisterDevice() is executed with
  an audio input device type preferred by the application specified to the
  argument deviceType in order to resister the audio input device into
  the system.
  When cellAudioInRegisterDevice() is called, the system software
  automatically assign a device number regardless of whether a matching audio
  input device is found or not. Whether the audio input device that has the
  device number is available or not can be checked through polling using
  cellMicIsAttached() of libmic or an event notification from libmic.

  Since a device number is automatically assigned as described above,
  when multiple USB devices(audio input device) of the type that the game
  application prefers are connected to PLAYSTATION(R)3, which device being
  connected to a USB port has which device number cannot be uniquely
  identified.
  In such case, a user interface should be implemented to identify it such
  as by displaying an indicator (volume) or the like on the screen.
  Note that a mechanism that can explicitly assign a device number to
  a specific device will be provided in the future release.

<Content Search Utility>
- When file paths to the still image and animation thumbnails of content
  are created using cellSearchPrepareFile() and the thumbnails are changed
  from the system software, the changes will not be reflected unless
  cellSearchPrepareFile() is executed again.

<Background Download utility>
- The following is a notice regarding the behavior of background downloads
  when they are performed while a game application is running.

  Although a background download will usually continue while a game
  application is running, it will be stopped by any one of the following
  conditions.

    - The game application has created more than one socket
    - There is more than one connection that uses the NP signaling utility
    - The AV chat utility or the AV chat 2 utility is being used

  The background download will resume once the condition that stopped it
  no longer applies. 
  Please do not create a game application that is dependent on the progress of
  background downloads.

  If new conditions are added to the above list of conditions that stop
  background downloads given the addition of a new utility, or if there are
  any changes regarding this issue, it will be announced in this technote.
  (TechnoteID:200803-15  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/708)

<Screenshot Utility>
(Added to Release 250.001)
- The value set to the PNG chunk is stored when it is copied from the 
  system software to an external media (Memory Stick(TM) or such), 
  however, when the stored data is imported into the system software, the 
  value is not reflected to the information screen of the system software.
  This is a current limitation but to be supported in the future system 
  software.

<Music Decode Utility>
(Added to Release 250.001)
- The following bugs have been found in the Music Decode utility:
  - When either of the commands CELL_MUSIC_DECODE_CMD_NEXT or 
    CELL_MUSIC_DECODE_CMD_PREV is issued during decode processing, 
    it may not move  to the next or the previous music correctly. 

  - When a specific music is used, the LPCM data cannot be obtained.
  (TechnoteID:200810-13  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/817)

<Photo Utility>
(Added to Release 250.001)
- When a 2MB or smaller memory container is specified to the argument 
  container2 of cellPhotoDecodeInitialize() for decoding and the function 
  is called, although the specified memory container size is sufficient 
  for decoding, it unconditionally returns CELL_PHOTO_DECODE_ERROR_PARAM 
  and fails to initialize the decode feature.
  (TechnoteID:200810-17  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/821)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
GTF
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 250.001)
- To use dds2gtf, the following restriction should be noted:
  - The UYVY and the YUY2 types are converted into the R8B8_R8G8 and the 
    B8R8_G8R8 types respectively, because no format that supports the GTF 
    is provided.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmixer
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The sample value to be specified for the argument "samples" of
  cellSurMixerSurBusAddData() must be multiples of 4.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libsail
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When playing back a PAMF file, few frames(1 to 3 frames) at the end of
  a stream cannot be obtained.

- Only the playback of a MP4 file that is placed on the built-in HDD is 
  guaranteed. Do not embed a source code that plays back other types of 
  MP4 file in the application.

(Added to Release 250.001)
- When playing back a movie using libsail, if a trick play is performed, 
  it does not work correctly.
  (TechnoteID:200810-02  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/806)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libperf
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the Lv-2 system call trace is enabled with the back trace
  on the program that is linked with libperf.a of SDK170 or before,
  it does not work on the target system that is updated to SDK 180 and
  later.
  (applicable to libperf\ppu sample)
  Please use libperf.a that is released after SDK 180.

- (B#43808)
  The Tuner for PLAYSTATION(R)3 cannot be used to measure the performance
  of the sample program of libperf because the measurement module on
  the target is utilized.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfs
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Updated in Release 250.001)
- As a part of the reduction in the memory usage of the system software
  in SDK220, the amount of memory that is used by the file system by
  default has been reduced.
  Due to this change, the performance may be degraded slightly as
  compared to SDK21x when data is written and read in finer units (16KB
  or less). Also, when multiple file accesses are made from multiple
  threads at the same time, the request processing time may slightly
  increase.
  Adding memory from the application using cellFsSetIoBuffer() or other 
  APIs that are newly added could improve but also degrade the performance.
  Be sure to check the performance before you introduce the method.

- When the number of files to open at the same
  time in the CFS(SYS_DEV_HDD0) exceeds the upper limit, an error is
  returned from SDK220 onwards.
  Please be noted that when you update SDK21x to SDK220, an error that
  was not returned previously may be observed.

- (B#47766)
  A bug has been found that blocks the file operation permanently
  after you specify 0 for the file size at calling cellFsTruncate()
  or cellFsFtruncate() for the /dev_hdd0.
  (TechnoteID:200804-07 https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/716)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cell OS Lv-2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The PPU program whose stack size is set to 4KB by
  SYS_PROCESS_PARAM can not be executed because a DSI occurs before
  the main function is called.

  [Workaround]
  Please set the stack size of a Primary PPU Thread to 8 KB or more.

(Added to Release 250.001)
- (B#58555)
  When the process termination and a system call that generates an object 
  from an interruption thread are called at the same time, the system 
  call returns EABORT.

  [Workaround]
  None

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libcamera
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Restrictions on the USB Video Class (UVC) Camera
  1. Does not support a UVC camera that is not compliant with the UVC
     even though it is USB 2.0 compliant.
  2. Does not support a camera that has no streaming function.
  3. Does not support a camera that is connected via the USB 1.1 hub.
  4. Does not support the mirror function.
  5. Support only a single camera.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libpad for Windows
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Only Windows XP is supported.
  Windows Vista will be supported in the future.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfont
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 250.001)
- When the rendering function is called from multiple threads at the 
  same time, the behavior may become undefined.
  To call the rendering function from multiple threads at the same time, 
  implement an exclusive operation such as the synchronization primitive 
  call of Cell OS Lv-2 to avoid the problem.

(Added to Release 250.001)
- When multiple external fonts are read repeatedly involving open/close 
  processings by calling cellFontOpenFontFile(), a memory leak occurs within 
  the library which may cause the library to hang up. 
  This problem will be fixed in the future release.

  To read the external fonts repeatedly, please apply either of 
  the following procedures until the bug is fixed.

  - Perform the open processing again including the termination/initialization 
    processings of the library.
  - Use cellFontOpenFontMemory().

- The vertical rendering function does not support the Chinese character
  positioning.
  Also, it does not replace the 2-byte () and {} into the vertical
  character codes when vertical character displacement is performed
  internally.
  To avoid this problem, directly specify the vertical character codes
  or use the single-byte () and {}.

- The function for vertical writing does not support the proportional
  vertical writing layout.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libftp
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Transfer speeds start to slow significantly once more than two
  simultaneous transfer streams are employed.

- It may fail to make a connection with Internet Explorer 6.0.

- Passive transfer mode (PASV) is currently not supported.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
cgc
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 250.001)
- (B#52202)
  With sce-cgc 1.6, when attempting to decide how many temporary register
  is required, and if it exceeds the limit, it may fail to compile a 
  specific vertex shader.
  Typical error message:
  (0) : error C6001: Temporary register limit of 32 exceeded; 34 
  registers needed to compile program

  If this error occurs at your end, please consider migrating to sce-cgc 
  2.0 because there is no plan to fix the problem.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- cellGcmSetZcull() cannot set the unbind feature for the Zcull area.
  To set the unbind feature for the Zcull area, use cellGcmUnbindZcull().

- When the tile setting is made for the overlapping areas in RSX(TM) using
  cellGcmSetTile(), the address conversion feature of RSX(TM) will not work
  correctly.

  Accordingly, new functions cellGcmSetTileInfo() and cellGcmBindTile()
  have been added to check whether the tile areas are overlapping.

  Please use cellGcmSetTileInfo(), cellGcmBindTile() and cellGcmUnbindTile()
  instead of cellGcmSetTile() and cellGcmSetInvalidateTile() for future
  development.
  cellGcmSetTile() and cellGcmSetInvalidateTile() will be removed in the
  future release.

(Added to Release 250.001)
- When debug versions of cellGcmSetSurface() and cellGcmSetSurfaceWindow() 
  are used, assertion may be incorrectly raised inside each function. 
  (TechnoteID:200807-25  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/777)

(Added to Release 250.001)
- In gcm samples, we have found an error setting of cellGcmSetViewport().
  However, this does not affect the behavior of the samples.
  (TechnoteID:200808-06  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/785)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard C/C++ Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<SPU>
- (B#20077) 
  When the new_handler is not set in the C++ library, and failed to allocate
  memory using "new", it enters into the infinite loop.

- If the following compile options are specified when compiling
  a program on the PPU side, many warnings may be output.

  -Wall -Wundef -Wundef -Wsystem-headers -Wcast-qual

- When including the system header, include it outside extern "C" or
  extern "C++".

  For example, an error may occur if a program such as below is compiled:

    extern "C" {
      ...

      #include <yyyy> // NG : Including within extern "C".

      ...
    }

  The error can be avoided by rewriting the program as shown below:

    #include <yyyy>
    extern "C" {

      ... 

    }

<PPU>
- When starting up a program in which <iostream> is included, the constructor
  of iostream will call the new operator. When you want to avoid calling
  "new" before executing the main function, do not use iostream.

<PPU>
- There are following limitations on the usage of atexit function.

  * If atexit function is used in a C++ global constructor, the behavior
    is different from the C++ standard.  All the registered functions are
    invoked prior to all the global destructors.
    The invokation order can partially be changed.  See "Toolchain User's 
    Guide for Cell OS Lv-2" for details.

<PPU>
- If you use class ios_base or any of its derived classes (fstream,
  iostream, stringstream, strstream, etc.) in PRX, create their
  instances in ELF, and pass the pointers to them to PRX.  If they are
  created in PRX, a DSI (data storage interrupt) may occur in function
  _Fac_tidy() at the termination of the PPU program.

(Added to Release 250.001)
<PPU>
- (B#49602)
  Since SDK220, SIMD math functions cbrtf4 and cbrtf4fast in math.h 
  have a bug and do not return results same as those of SDK210 or before.

  Example:
  vec_float4 vf = (vec_float4){1.73e-2f, 3.0f, 27.0f, FLT_MAX};
  printf("%vf\n", cbrtf4(vf));

 Result of SDK210 or before: 0.258632  1.442249  3.000000  6981462523904.000409
 Result of SDK220 or later:  0.258681  1.372409 -5.020100  nan

  The bug will be fixed in the future SDK.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Custome Theme
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the effect sound data is too long, the sound may be interrupted 
  at a specific stage. Please refer to the "Custom Theme Specifications" 
  document for more details.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmic
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 250.001)
- CELLMIC_DEVATTR_LED controls LED light only when 
  EyeToy USB Camera(for PlayStation 2) and PLAYSTATION(R)Eye are 
  in camera mode also.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfios
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 250.001)
- To use Edge Zlib or Edge LZMA, download and install PLAYSTATION(R)Edge 
  0.4.2.

(Added to Release 250.001)
- When creating an archive file, if the archive target file and the 
  output file have the same name and either the -y option or the 
  --overwrite option is specified, the archive target file will be 
  overwritten and unrestorable.

(Added to Release 250.001)
- When scheduler::readDirectory() is executed for a directory which is 
  overlayed and thus set as a redirect directory, the redirect setting is 
  not reflected and the directry entry of the original directory is read.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
dt Command
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When boot=dbg is set using a dtcparam that is provided in SDK192 or
  before and the boot parameter is displayed using the dtcparam command
  in SDK200 or later, boot=unknown is displayed. Reset boot=dbg using the
  dtcparam command in SDK200 or later.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SPU Runtime Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<libspurs Job>
(Added to Release 250.001)
- (B#61734)
  The following is restricted with cellSpursCheckJob():
  - The job descriptor, in which CELL_SPURS_JOB_TYPE_MEMORY_CHECK 
    is set to jobType of the job descripter header, may possibly 
    return CELL_SPURS_JOB_ERROR_MEMORY_SIZE when the size of either 
    input buffer or output buffer is 0. In this case, CELL_OK should be 
    rather returned.
    With cellSpursJobQueueCheckJob(), in addition to the restriction above, 
    this bug also occurs when the size of the scratch buffer is set to 0.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Matching 2 Utility
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 250.001)
- When 2 users attempt to enter into a lobby where no one is present, 
  a problem occurs that the users get entered into separate lobbies 
  respectively. Note that the same Server ID, World ID, Lobby ID and 
  Lobby Member ID are notified to both users when they successfully join
  the lobbies.

(Added to Release 250.001)
- sceNpMatching2SignalingGetPingInfo() is a function that 
  obtains the RTT for a room owner of specified room ID. 
  However, although the NAT type of the room owner is 
  NAT type 1 or NAT type 2, the function returns the time 
  out error (SCE_NP_SIGNALING_ERROR_TIMEOUT) in most 
  cases except when the room owner is accessible directly 
  from the external network.
  (TechnoteID:200810-16  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/820)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Control Console
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The Control Console Client library is available only with
  the Visual Studio 2005.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libad
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 250.001)
- (B#60616)
  A race condition in the async library can cause sceAdAsyncSpaceOpen()
  and sceAdAsyncSpaceClose() to be unstable. All titles must avoid
  calling either of these function, as there is a potential for the
  title to crash. Instead, call sceAdGetSpaceInfo() or
  sceAdGetAssetInfo(). The title can choose to manage its own timers and
  perform ad rotation manually. However, the library provided
  mechanism for ad rotation must not be used.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmstream
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 250.001)
- The "SNC Release" build configuration for the simple_createdsp_td and 
  dsp_sample samples contain a wrong output filename causing the built 
  executables to fail. 
  The samples can be executed by changing the executable names to output 
  from ".self" to ".elf" through the project property.

- The maximum size of a single DSP page will be limited to 12 KB.
  When using the DSP function, the length of the file size that is 
  specified to filesize must not exceed 12KB.
  Note that the maximum size of a single DSP page is defined by 
  CELL_MS_DSP_PAGESIZE in mstream.h. 

- cellMSSystemConfigureSysUtil() is to be deleted in the future.
  Please migrate to cellMSSystemConfigureSysUtilEx(), that has been added
  to SDK200.002, in the game application.

- In Time Domain only mode, ADPCM data at low sample rates (< 24khz)
  can cause noise.

- When each sample is compiled using the SNC compiler, the sample data may not
  be loaded correctly because the environment variable CELL_SDK is used in
  the sample data path.

  When the CELL_SDK is defined with a path other than "\usr\local\cell\",
  it is required to alter the SAMPLE_CELL_SDK path in the sample source
  according to the environment.

  This problem does not occur when the GCC compiler is used.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
vectormath
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 250.001)
- A precision problem has been found in the SIMD value operation function 
  "cbrtf4(vector float)" of the C/C++ standard library of the PPU version. 
  Because the Vectormath function "cbrtf(floatInVec)" uses this function, 
  the same precision problem occurs with the PPU version of the Vectormath.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
DECI3 CTRLP
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 250.001)
- Because the ProDG Target Manager for PLAYSTATION(R)3 of v250.1 or 
  later uses CTRLP to establish a connection, when the ProDG 
  Target Manager for PLAYSTATION(R)3 is connected with a target, 
  the cell\host-common\samples\ctrlp sample program does not work. 
  When the sample program is started up, it shows "dt_register error" 
  and is terminated. 

  To run the ctrlp sample, disconnect the ProDG Target Manager 
  for PLAYSTATION(R)3.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libvoice
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 250.001)
- CellVoiceStart() and CellVoiceStartEx() don't return
  CELL_VOICE_ERROR_SERVICE_ATTACHED and
  CELL_VOICE_ERROR_SERVICE_DETACHED error code. 
  The reference document has these two return values listed for these 
  two APIs. The description of the libvoice memory configuration in 
  the overview doesn't reflect the above change either.
