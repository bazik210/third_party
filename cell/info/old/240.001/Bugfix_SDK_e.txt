  - Release 240.001 Bug Fixes

======================================================================
Bug Fixes in Release 240.001
======================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Software
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The following bug has been fixed.

  - (B#51796)
    When an SPU thread group with its thread status set to NOT 
    INITIALIZED exists in the game application when core dumping, the 
    output processing of the core file will be interrupted.

< Check menu in the Game column >
- During the check performed from the Check menu in the Game column, a 
  file that is non-map file is wrongly identified as a map file. This 
  problem has been fixed.

- When performing the check from the Check menu in the Game column, 
  if the PARENTAL_LEVEL parameter is not contained in PARAM.SFO of 
  the game data or the save data, it is treated as an error. 
  This problem has been fixed. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Utilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
< SubDisplay Utility>
- The following bug has been fixed.

  - (B#49155) 
    When cellSubDisplayInit() is called at the same time as the wired LAN is 
    initialized(the interface is started), it may fail to call the function.

< Video Upload Utility >
- The following bug has been fixed.

  - When uploading a file to YouTube, an error occurs when '&' is contained 
    in the string that is pointed by any of the following members of 
    the CellVideoUploadParam structure that is specified by the first argument 
    of cellVideoUploadInitialize(), or in the title string that is input by 
    a user when the utility is activated (0x8002d001).

      u.youtube.pTitle_UTF8
      u.youtube.pDescription_UTF8
      u.youtube.pKeyword_1_UTF8
      u.youtube.pKeyword_2_UTF8
      u.youtube.pKeyword_3_UTF8

    Also note that when '<' and '>' are contained in any of the strings, 
    they are automatically deleted and if the string becomes empty as 
    a result of the deletion, an error occurs at the time of the upload
    (0x8002d001).

< Audio Configuration Utility >
- The time takes to perform the processing of 
  cellAudioInGetAvailableDeviceInfo() has been improved.

< Music Utility >
- The following bug has been fixed.

  - When the execution of cellMusicSetPlaybackCommand() terminates normally,
    the callback function [specified in the fourth argument, func,
    of cellMusicInitialize()] is not called as it should be.
    This bug does not occur with cellMusicSetPlaybackCommand2().
    (TechnoteID:200803-08  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/701)

- The following bug has been fixed.

  - With the playback feature that does not use the memory container, when
    all songs are repeated and the shuffle is set to ON, the last song
    cannot be skipped (Next) and fast-rewinding to the previous song is not
    possible with the first song, and then it stops playing.

- The following bug has been fixed.

  - At the change of the songs, callback functions of
    cellMusicSelectContents() / cellMusicSelectContents2() are not called.
    The value to be returned by the playback function is
    CELL_MUSIC_ERROR_BUSY / CELL_MUSIC2_ERROR_BUSY.

- The following bug has been fixed.

  - When cellMusicSetSelectionContext() or cellMusicSetSelectionContext2() is 
    executed while playing back an audio file using the music utility, 
    the callback function may not be executed.
    (TechnoteID:200804-27 https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/736)

< Game Content Utility >
- The bug in obtaining the current title information by the disc boot game 
  has been fixed.

  When the boot information obtain function cellGameBootCheck() is called 
  by the disc boot game and cellGameGetParamString() to obtain the current 
  title information, if the title name in the set language is not defined in 
  PARAM.SFO, the title name cannot be  obtained.
  This problem has been fixed to return the default title name when an attempt 
  to obtain the current title name is made if the title name in the set 
  language is not defined in PARAM.SFO. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- (B#52487)
  When a command that is created using cellGcmSetFlip() or 
  cellGcmSetPrepareFlip() is executed and a buffer ID is not registered,
  a memory corruption may occur. This problem has been fixed.
  If the buffer ID registration is not performed, a message indicating 
  "flip preparation error" will be displayed.

- (B#50684),(B#52307)
  In the debug version of cellGcmSetRenderEnable(), when a value 2048 
  or larger is specified to the argument "index", an error occurs. This 
  problem has been fixed.
  A value up to 1M(1024*1024) can be specified to "index" now.

- (B#51153)
  In the following GCM Method Macros, an unnecessary semicolon was added 
  at the end of each macros. This problem has been fixed.
   CELL_GCM_METHOD_HEADER_DRAW_INDEX_ARRAY()
   CELL_GCM_METHOD_HEADER_DRAW_INDEX_ARRAY_NI()
   CELL_GCM_METHOD_HEADER_BEGIN_END()

- The following bug has been fixed.

  - (B#51888)

  The errors in the following items in the message that is displayed when 
  RSX(R) ends with a hardware exception have been modified:
   - "Size" item in the tile setting list
   - IO offset of the corresponding error(in the case of the graphics 
     error 256, 257 and 512)

- (B#47893)
  The error in the following item in the message that is displayed when 
  RSX(R) ends with a hardware exception has been modified:
  
   - The value of MAX ANISO to set(in the case of the graphics error 
     261 and 262)
       "1" -> "CELL_GCM_TEXTURE_MAX_ANISO_1"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libcgutil
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- (B#48992)
  In the library file for Visual Studio libcgutil.lib, when a user 
  application is built in a debug mode, a warning message indicating 
  "The debug information cannot be found" is issued as "warning 
  LNK4204". This problem has been fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm_pm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- (B#48404)
  A measurement result that is obtained using the 
  CELL_GCM_PM_SCLK_PREROP_VALID_PACKET event is not correct. This 
  problem has been fixed.
  (Technote ID:200805-02 https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/738)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm_tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The /GL option of host-win32\lib\libgcm_tool.lib has been removed.
  In the past release, because the /GL option of the Microsoft Visual 
  Studio 2005 compiler was enabled, compilers of different versions 
  could not be linked.
  From this release onwards, a binary from which /GL option is removed 
  will be released to resolve the compatibility problem between the 
  different environments. Accordingly, the link speed will be improved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

   that were added to SDK 220 is used for a HOSTFS file, an incorrect 
   data may be read.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cell OS Lv-2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The following bug has been fixed.

  - (B#52610)
    If a physical memory that is being mapped using 
    sys_mmapper_map_memory() is freed using sys_mmapper_free_memory(),
    a kernel panic may occur.

- The following bug has been fixed.

  - (B#47188)
    When the game process is terminated without discarding the virtual
    memory that is generated using sys_vm_memory_map(), the system may crash.

  - (B#47394)
    When a memory straddling both a vertual memory area and an unmapped
    area is passed to the system call, the kernel may get panicked.

- The following bug has been fixed.

  - (B#49152)
    When sys_vm_get_statistics() is called to obtain statistics information 
    for a virtual memory area that has been allocated with a 1MB page size, 
    the amount of physical memory being used as represented by the pmem_used 
    variable of the sys_vm_statistics_t structure is always 0.
    (TechnoteID:200804-19 https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/728)

- The following bug has been fixed.

  - (B#51397)
    A kernel panic can occur for a virtual memory area if its physical 
    memory allocation is still locked with sys_vm_lock() when unmapped.
    (TechnoteID:200805-01 https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/737)

- The following bug has been fixed.

  - (B#52227)

    the SPU thread may no longer operate.
    (TechnoteID:200806-07  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/750)

- The following bug has been fixed.

  - (B#49618)
    Because there is no definition of NULL in spu_thread.h and 
    spu_thread_group.h, they cannot be included separately.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SPU Runtime Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Common>
- (B#48427)

  occur due to a duplicated link. This problem has been fixed.

<libsync>
- The following bug has been fixed.

  - (B#50813)
    When a lock-free queue is initialized with CELL_SYNC_QUEUE_ANY2ANY
    set to the argument "direction" of cellSyncLFQueueInitialize(),
    a PPU thread calling one of the following functions on the
    lock-free queue might not be blocked.

    - cellSyncLFQueuePush()
    - cellSyncLFQueuePop()
    (TechnoteID:200804-14  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/723)

<libspurs Task>
- The following bug has been fixed.

  - (B#50813)

  calling cellFiberPpuJoin(), an assert may occur. This problem has been 
  fixed.

- (B#51360)
  When it returns from the entry function of the PPU fiber context, the 
  behavior becomes unstable. This problem has been fixed. An illegal 
  instruction exception is always invoked now.

- (B#51620)
  When cellFiberPpuYield() or cellFiberPpuWaitFlag() is called under a 
  condition that a signal is already received by the PPU fiber, the signal
  may be lost. This problem has been fixed.

- (B#53057)
  - In the advaced\function_offload_tutorial sample, the following problem
    has been fixed:
    - Because the sample framework is used internally but the dependency 
      of the builds is not set, building a sample does not invoke 
      the build of the sample framework.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libpad
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The following bugs have been fixed:

  (B#52659)
  - When button data is notified to the system using 
    cellPadLddDataInsert(), and the dialog of the system utility is 
    opened, subsequent button data notifications will be also passed to 
    the game application.

  (B#31640)
  - When the BD remote controller is returned from the waiting state, the 
    button data that is operated first may not be obtained.

  (B#49777)
  - The system hangs up due to a failure in allocating resources when a 
    controller is connected or similar.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libusbd
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following errors may occur instantaneously due to any cause 
when either of the control, the bulk and the interrupt transfers is 
performed:
(Such transfer will fail due to the following errors.)

- CRC error is returned from the device
- PID error is returned from the device
- Timeout occurs due to no response from the device

Although the device condition returns to normal by itself even without 
unplugging/plugging the device, and the data is transferred successfully, 
a transfer error (EHCI_CC_XACT) is returned to "result" of the callback 
of the following functions. This problem has been fixed.

- cellUsbdBulkTransfer()
- cellUsbdInterruptTransfer()

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(B#35598)
- When the ## operator is used, it does not return an error at the time 
  of pre-processing. This problem has been fixed. (From SDK240 onwards, 
  since the use of the ## operator is not allowed, an error is returned 
  at the time of pre processing as expected.)

(B#43966)
- When multiple write masks are used, an invalid code may be output. 
  This problem has been fixed.
  
  Example)
  float4 temp;
  temp.xy.x = ...;

  passes 0 to the argument currentOffset.
  This problem has been fixed to pass a correct positional information 
  of the stream. 

- When a Multistream game application is built using the SNC compiler, 
  *.self cannot be created and executed correctly.
  This problem has been fixed. 

- (B#50653)/(B#48593)
  In the simple_reverb_td sample, because the variable ret, that is used 
  in the function ModifyReverb, is not initialized, a warning message 
  indicating "Implicit reference" is displayed.
  This problem has been fixed to initialize the variable ret and 
  the warning message is no longer displayed. 

- In the simple_delay sample, because the variable fCutoff, that is used 
  in the function ModifyDelay, is not initialized, a warning message 
  indicating "Implicit reference" is displayed. 
  This problem has been fixed to initialize the variable fCutoff and 
  the warning message is no longer displayed. 

- (B#42080)
  When any multistream sample is built using the SNC compiler, a warning 
  message indicating "Unrecognized option -fno-rtti ignored" is displayed.
  This problem has been fixed by deleting the -fno-rtti option from 
  the Makefile. 

- (B#48521)
  In the surround_sample sample, when building a Visual Studio project using 
  the SNC compiler, it fails to link the Framework library and build 
  the project.
  To avoid this problem, the Visual Studio project file has been fixed to 
  rebuild the Framework library using the SNC compiler before linking. 

- (B#52936)
  In libmsteam, 8 or more of libaudio block size cannot be used.
  This problem has been fixed to refer to the libaudio block size at 
  the initialization so that a correct block size is used.

- (B#52939)
  The value of a single DSP page size (CELL_MS_DSP_PAGESIZE : 16KB) 
  that is defined in cell\target\ppu\include\cell\mstream.h is not correct.

  The time domain only mode generates corrupted data when CELL_MS_TD_ONLY_128 
  is specified to the MultiStream system configuration information.
  This problem has been fixed.

- (B#52944)
  The time domain only mode cannot output an audio when the MultiStream 
  ATRAC(TM) Thread libraries (libmstreamThreadAT3.a or libmstreamSPURSAT3.a) 
  are used.
  This problem has been fixed to output an audio by passing 
  the CELL_MS_TD_ONLY_XXX flag at the initialization of the libraries.

  Note that when the CELL_MS_TD_ONLY_XXX flag is set with the following 
  functions, the MP3 library (libmstreamSPURSMP3.a) must be linked:
  - cellMSSystemInitSPURS()
  - cellMSSystemInitSPUThread()
  - cellMSSystemGetNeededMemorySize()

- (B#52479)
