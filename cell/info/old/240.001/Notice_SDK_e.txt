======================================================================
The following are known bugs, limitations and cautions on 
the Reference Tool SDK package.

New updates have the release version of this package. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reference Tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- For specifications regarding the Reference Tool, please refer to 
  SDK_doc\jp(en)\pdf\development_basic\Reference_System-Supplement_*.pdf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
CBE Specifications
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Currently, the CBE that is equipped with each tool version can use 
  six SPUs. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Software
----------------------------------------------------------------------
< Check menu in the Game column >
- Validation of a media or the file system itself cannot be performed 
  from the Check menu in the Game column.

  When submitting a master disc, make sure to verify the disc that no error
  is present using the Disc Image Generator for PLAYSTATION(R)3 or
  the Disc Image Checker for PLAYSTATION(R)3.

(Added to Release 240.001)
- When performing the check from the Check menu in the Game column, 
  if the number of result files exceeds approximately 80 to 100 depending 
  on each check item, the file entries of the root directory in the USB 
  mass storage run out and the subsequent check result files may no 
  longer be stored.
  In such case, move the check result files to another directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Utilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
< SubDisplay Utility>
- (B#41848)
  To use the subdisplay utility, the PSP(TM) system software version 3.72
  or later is required.

< Access Point Utility >
- To check the connection with PSP(TM), a ps3scan utility that is to be
  released from PSP(TM) SDK3.80 is required.

< Remote Play Utility >
- (B#41848)
  To perform remote play with the PLAYSTATION(R)3 system software version
  2.10 or later, PSP(TM) system software version 3.72 or later is required.

< Content Search Utility >
- When file paths to the still image and animation thumbnails of content
  are created using cellSearchPrepareFile() and the thumbnails are changed
  from the system software, the changes will not be reflected unless
  cellSearchPrepareFile() is executed again.

<On-Screen Keyboard Utility>
- The optional dictionary feature is not supported.

< Audio Configuration Utility >
- cellAudioInGetAvailableDeviceInfo() does not support devices such as
  EyeToy USB Camera(for PlayStation 2)/PLAYSTATION(R)Eye.
  Those devices will be supported in the future release.

- In the multi microphone mode, cellAudioInRegisterDevice() is executed with
  an audio input device type preferred by the application specified to the
  argument deviceType in order to resister the audio input device into
  the system.
  When cellAudioInRegisterDevice() is called, the system software
  automatically assign a device number regardless of whether a matching audio
  input device is found or not. Whether the audio input device that has the
  device number is available or not can be checked through polling using
  cellMicIsAttached() of libmic or an event notification from libmic.

  Since a device number is automatically assigned as described above,
  when multiple USB devices(audio input device) of the type that the game
  application prefers are connected to PLAYSTATION(R)3, which device being
  connected to a USB port has which device number cannot be uniquely
  identified.
  In such case, a user interface should be implemented to identify it such
  as by displaying an indicator (volume) or the like on the screen.
  Note that a mechanism that can explicitly assign a device number to
  a specific device will be provided in the future release.

< Video Configuration Utility >
- With SDK210 or before, the resolutions such as 960x1080/1280x1080/1440x1080/
  1600x1080 were not available when the resolution of the movie output is set 
  to WUXGA in the development environment, however this limitation has been
  removed.

< Music Utility >
(Added to Release 240.001)
- The repeat mode may be unable to be set from the content selection UI.
  The procedure that causes this problem is as shown below:

  1. Call cellSearchGetMusicSelectionContextOfSingleTrack() and get a
     selection context for playing back a single track.
  2. Call cellMusicSetSelectionContext() or cellMusicSetSelectionContext2().
  3. Call cellMusicSelectContents() or cellMusicSelectContents2() to 
     change the repeat mode of the playback mode. The setting will not be 
     reflected and a single music is played.
     This problem will be fixed in SDK250.

< Game Update Utility >
-  When the Reference Tool is booted having "Debugger mode" specified to
   "Boot parameters" using the Administration Tool or the like,
   the patch distribution feature of the Game Update utility cannot be
   utilized.

< Web Browser Utility>
- Files cannot be downloaded with the downloader.

- The handler onMouseOver/onMouseOut of JavaScript does not work
  properly. Use onFocus/onBlur instead.

- The performance may be slow when using ClickableMap.

- Only the photo file in the Photo column of the system software (GUI) can be 
  selected to upload.

< Background Download utility >
- The following is a notice regarding the behavior of background downloads
  when they are performed while a game application is running.

  Although a background download will usually continue while a game
  application is running, it will be stopped by any one of the following
  conditions.

    - The game application has created more than one socket
    - There is more than one connection that uses the NP signaling utility
    - The AV chat utility or the AV chat 2 utility is being used

  The background download will resume once the condition that stopped it
  no longer applies. 
  Please do not create a game application that is dependent on the progress of
  background downloads.

  If new conditions are added to the above list of conditions that stop
  background downloads given the addition of a new utility, or if there are
  any changes regarding this issue, it will be announced in this technote.
  (TechnoteID:200803-15  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/708)

< Message Dialog Utility >
(Added to Release 240.001)
- In the message dialog utility, if both CELL_MSGDIALOG_TYPE_BUTTON_TYPE_NONE 
  and CELL_MSGDIALOG_TYPE_DISABLE_CANCEL_ON are not specified to the argument 
  "type" of cellMsgDialogOpen2(), the user can close the displayed message 
  dialog by pressing the circle or the cross buttons.

  After the user pressed either of the buttons to close the message dialog, 
  400msec of delay at maximum may occur until a result notification callback 
  is issued for the dialog.  If the game application calls cellMsgDialogClose()
   before this callback is issued, it may hang up.

  [Workaround] 
  To avoid this problem, specify a value that is 400.0f or more to the argument
   "delayTime" of cellMsgDialogClose() or do not call cellMsgDialogClose() 
  until the result notification callback is issued. 

< Game Data Utility/HDD Boot Game Utility >
(Added to Release 240.001)
- The functions for the patch program cellGameDataSetSystemVer() and 
  cellHddGameSetSystemVer() will be removed in the future release.

  The Title Patch Publishing System (TPPS) will be provided to apply a patch 
  program in the future.
  Please refer to the technote ID 200804-17
  (https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/726) for more details.
  When the TPPS is used, cellGameDataSetSystemVer() and 
  cellHddGameSetSystemVer() is not required.

< AV Chat 2 utility >
(Added to Release 240.001)
- To use the direct streaming mode, it is required to perform signaling 
  between players using the NP signaling library in the game. 
  This restriction will be removed from the future release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cell OS Lv-2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- If you try to create upper limit or more memory containers with
  sys_memory_container_create(), an ID that is the same as that of
  the memory container that has already been allocated is returned
  for a new memory container. When this occurs, the older memory
  container may not be destroyed with sys_memory_container_destroy()
  and may not be retrieved by the system even at the time of game
  process termination.

  [Workaround]
  Please make sure that the number of memory containers to be created
  with a game process at the same time is less than 10.

- The PPU program whose stack size is set to 4KB by
  SYS_PROCESS_PARAM can not be executed because a DSI occurs before
  the main function is called.

  [Workaround]
  Please set the stack size of a Primary PPU Thread to 8 KB or more.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfont
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The vertical rendering function does not support the Chinese character
  positioning.
  Also, it does not replace the 2-byte () and {} into the vertical
  character codes when vertical character displacement is performed
  internally.
  To avoid this problem, directly specify the vertical character codes
  or use the single-byte () and {}.

- The function for vertical writing does not support the proportional
  vertical writing layout.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfs
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- As a part of the reduction in the memory usage of the system software
  in SDK220, the amount of memory that is used by the file system by
  default has been reduced.
  Due to this change, the performance may be degraded slightly as
  compared to SDK21x when data is written and read in finer units (16KB
  or less). Also, when multiple file accesses are made from multiple
  threads at the same time, the request processing time may slightly
  increase.
  The performance can be increased by adding memory upon request of the
  application using an API such as cellFsSetIoBuffer that is newly added.

- When the number of files to open at the same
  time in the CFS(SYS_DEV_HDD0) exceeds the upper limit, an error is
  returned from SDK220 onwards.
  Please be noted that when you update SDK21x to SDK220, an error that
  was not returned previously may be observed.

- (B#47766)
  A bug has been found that blocks the file operation permanently
  after you specify 0 for the file size at calling cellFsTruncate()
  or cellFsFtruncate() for the /dev_hdd0.
  (TechnoteID:200804-07 https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/716)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libperf
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the Lv-2 system call trace is enabled with the back trace
  on the program that is linked with libperf.a of SDK170 or before,
  it does not work on the target system that is updated to SDK 180 and
  later.
  (applicable to libperf\ppu sample)
  Please use libperf.a that is released after SDK 180.

- (B#43808)
  The Tuner for PLAYSTATION(R)3 cannot be used to measure the performance
  of the sample program of libperf because the measurement module on
  the target is utilized.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libftp
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Transfer speeds start to slow significantly once more than two
  simultaneous transfer streams are employed.

- It may fail to make a connection with Internet Explorer 6.0.

- Passive transfer mode (PASV) is currently not supported.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libsail
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When playing back a PAMF file, few frames(1 to 3 frames) at the end of
  a stream cannot be obtained.

- Only the playback of a MP4 file that is placed on the built-in HDD is 
  guaranteed. Do not embed a source code that plays back other types of 
  MP4 file in the application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libusbd
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When connecting or disconnecting a device to a USB port of the
  machine body, other USB devices already connected may be
  disconnected or may have an impact on its data communication.
  To avoid these problems, connect a self power hub to one of the USB
  ports of the machine body.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- cellGcmSetZcull() cannot set the unbind feature for the Zcull area.
  To set the unbind feature for the Zcull area, use cellGcmUnbindZcull().

- When the tile setting is made for the overlapping areas in RSX(TM) using
  cellGcmSetTile(), the address conversion feature of RSX(TM) will not work
  correctly.

  Accordingly, new functions cellGcmSetTileInfo() and cellGcmBindTile()
  have been added to check whether the tile areas are overlapping.

  Please use cellGcmSetTileInfo(), cellGcmBindTile() and cellGcmUnbindTile()
  instead of cellGcmSetTile() and cellGcmSetInvalidateTile() for future
  development.
  cellGcmSetTile() and cellGcmSetInvalidateTile() will be removed in the
  future release.

(Added to Release 240.001)
- cellGcmCgGetParameterOrdinalNumber() returns an unexpected value.
  In this release of sce-cgc, a correct value is not returned because it 
  is required to modify the sce-cgc compiler to fix this problem. 
  It will be fixed in the future release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libcgutil
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 240.001)
- cellGcmCgGetParameterOrdinalNumber() returns an unexpected value.
  In this release of sce-cgc, a correct value is not returned because it
  is required to modify the sce-cgc compiler to fix this problem. 
  It will be fixed in the future release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libcamera
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Restrictions on the USB Video Class (UVC) Camera
  1. Does not support a UVC camera that is not compliant with the UVC
     even though it is USB 2.0 compliant.
  2. Does not support a camera that has no streaming function.
  3. Does not support a camera that is connected via the USB 1.1 hub.
  4. Does not support the mirror function.
  5. Support only a single camera.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libpad for Windows
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Only Windows XP is supported.
  Windows Vista will be supported in the future.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
dt Command
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When boot=dbg is set using a dtcparam that is provided in SDK192 or
  before and the boot parameter is displayed using the dtcparam command
  in SDK200 or later, boot=unknown is displayed. Reset boot=dbg using the
  dtcparam command in SDK200 or later.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
dtlib
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 240.001)
- host-common\samples\loopback\Win does not work correctly when it is 
  built using Visual Studio 2008 because dtlib for Visual Studio 2008 
  is not provided.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Control Console
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The Control Console Client library is available only with
  the Visual Studio 2005.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Matching 2 Utility
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When an error occurs and a session of the NP matching 2 service becomes 
  disconnected, the session may remain on the server without being cleared 
  as it should be.  This will enable you to obtain session information 
  that should not normally be obtained. However, an attempt to join 
  the session will fail.
  (TechnoteID:200804-15   https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/724)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Title User Storage Utility
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 240.001)
- A server for the NP title user storage services will be available 
  for end users from July, 2008. Please refer to the SDK Roadmap on the 
  PS3 Developer Network web site for the latest schedule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Basic Utility
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added in Release 240.001)
- The number of friends that can be registered in the Friend column 
  has been increased to 100. 
  Note that any game title that is compiled using an SDK older than 
  240 can recognize only 50 friends in order to keep the compatibility.
  When there are 51 friends or more, the system will preferentially 
  select 50 users whose status is online. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Sample Program
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added in Release 240.001)
- When many friends are registered with PLAYSTATION(R)Network, 
  the event queue will be full in the following sample and EBUSY may be 
  returned from sys_event_port_send().
  cell\samples\sdk\network\np\np_game

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard C/C++ Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<SPU>
- (B#20077) 
  When the new_handler is not set in the C++ library, and failed to allocate
  memory using "new", it enters into the infinite loop.

- If the following compile options are specified when compiling
  a program on the PPU side, many warnings may be output.

  -Wall -Wundef -Wundef -Wsystem-headers -Wcast-qual

- When including the system header, include it outside extern "C" or
  extern "C++".

  For example, an error may occur if a program such as below is compiled:

    extern "C" {
      ...

      #include <yyyy> // NG : Including within extern "C".

      ...
    }

  The error can be avoided by rewriting the program as shown below:

    #include <yyyy>
    extern "C" {

      ... 

    }

<PPU>
- When starting up a program in which <iostream> is included, the constructor
  of iostream will call the new operator. When you want to avoid calling
  "new" before executing the main function, do not use iostream.

<PPU>
- There are following limitations on the usage of atexit function.

  * If atexit function is used in a C++ global constructor, the behavior
    is different from the C++ standard.  All the registered functions are
    invoked prior to all the global destructors.
    The invokation order can partially be changed.  See "Toolchain User's 
    Guide for Cell OS Lv-2" for details.

<PPU>
- If you use class ios_base or any of its derived classes (fstream,
  iostream, stringstream, strstream, etc.) in PRX, create their
  instances in ELF, and pass the pointers to them to PRX.  If they are
  created in PRX, a DSI (data storage interrupt) may occur in function
  _Fac_tidy() at the termination of the PPU program.

<SPU>
- If very large amount of stack or heap area is used, heap area may be
  destroyed.  SPU ABI allows accessing memory at negative offsets from
  stack pointer up to -2000 as well as positive offsets, but using
  negative offsets is not guaranteed in some cases due to a bug.
  Negative offsets from stack pointer are used in spu_printf(), leaf
  functions, etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmixer
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The sample value to be specified for the argument "samples" of
  cellSurMixerSurBusAddData() must be multiples of 4.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NVShaderPerf
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When a fragment shader, with a conditional branch or a loop block written 
  at the end of its program, is compiled; the correct binary may not be output.
  (TechnoteID:200804-18 https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/727)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libvoice
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 240.001)
- Multimicrophones are not supported. 

(Added to Release 240.001)
- CellVoicePortParam:
  Please set playerId as 0 inside the device struct.  
  Any value other than 0 will not be accepted.

(Added to Release 240.001)
- CellVoiceDebugTopology is not yet implemented.

(Added to Release 240.001)
- CELL_OK is currently returned when creating a PCM buffer with 
  bufSize >= 64, but no audio output is generated. Applications  
  should limit PCM bufSize to less than 64K bytes.

(Added to Release 240.001)
- Clarification on cellVoiceSetPortAttr/cellVoiceGetPortAttr APIs: 
  * CellMicSignalAttr/CellMicSignalState passthrough is not yet 
    implemented. 

(Added to Release 240.001)
- Applications must call cellVoiceEnd before exiting to ensure 
  proper cleanup.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BD Emulator
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 240.001)
- When an eject operation is performed while using the BD emulator, a 
  DSI occurs on the Lv-2 OS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmstream
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 240.001)
- The maximum size of a single DSP page will be limited to 12 KB.
  When using the DSP function, the length of the file size that is 
  specified to filesize must not exceed 12KB.
  Note that the maximum size of a single DSP page is defined by 
  CELL_MS_DSP_PAGESIZE in mstream.h. 

- cellMSSystemConfigureSysUtil() is to be deleted in the future.
  Please migrate to cellMSSystemConfigureSysUtilEx(), that has been added
  to SDK200.002, in the game application.

- In Time Domain only mode, ADPCM data at low sample rates (< 24khz)
  can cause noise.

- When samples are compiled individually using the project file that is
  contained in each sample, it is required to build dependencies among
  the following samples.
  Please refer to readme_*.txt of each sample for more details.
  Note that when the whole samples are compiled using the project files
  (samples.sln/samples-2005.sln) or the makefile contained immediately under
  samples\sdk\sound\multistream, the dependencies can be ignored.

  dsp_sample
  eq_sample
  rain_sample
  simple_created_td
  simple_created_fd

- When each sample is compiled using the SNC compiler, the sample data may not
  be loaded correctly because the environment variable CELL_SDK is used in
  the sample data path.

  When the CELL_SDK is defined with a path other than "\usr\local\cell\",
  it is required to alter the SAMPLE_CELL_SDK path in the sample source
  according to the environment.

  This problem does not occur when the GCC compiler is used.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sample Program(cell\samples)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the following samples are built using the SNC PPU Toolchain,
  they do not behave correctly and a deadlock occurs. Note that a sample
  that is built using GCC411 runs normally.

  samples\tutorial\ParticleSimulator\07_spu_particles_spurs_task
  samples\tutorial\ParticleSimulator\08_spu_particles_gl_events

(Updated to Release 240.001)
- When booting the self file of the following samples using
  the Reference Tool in the debugger mode, confirm that the following
  message is output to the TTY:

  Samples:
  samples\sdk\sysutil\avc\videochat
  samples\sdk\sysutil\avc\voicechat

  Message:
   "*** network ready. myaddr: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX ***"
    (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX indicates the IP address of your PLAYSTATION(R)3.)

  When the self file is booted before the message is output, the samples
  do not run correctly because it assumes that the network is not connected.

(Added to Release 240.001)
- Because the glut library is not released for 64bit Windows, 
  the cell\samples\sdk\control_console\perf_gui sample cannot be built 
  on Windows Vista 64bit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libad
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 240.001)
- (B#56154)
  Although the http proxy server is set via the network settings of 
  the system software, the library does not use the setting. 
  The library itself is designed to support the proxy servers, however, 
  the proxy server setting is not reflected because of this bug.

  Game applications do not crash or access an invalid memory, but a user 
  accessing Internet using the proxy server cannot receive dynamic in-game 
  advertisement data that is sent from the server or send a viewer report 
  to the server.
