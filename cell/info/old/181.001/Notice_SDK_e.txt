======================================================================
The following are known bugs, limitations and cautions on 
the Reference Tool SDK package.

New updates have the release version of this package. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reference Tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- A problem has been found that when a program that outputs voice 
  from RSX(TM) is activated, and then one of the following is 
  performed, voice is not output.
  - Plug-in/out the HDMI cable
  - Switch the TV monitor power from Off to On (including the AV Amp)
  - Switch between the TV monitor channels and set the HDMI input again
    (including the AV Amp)

- The following devices are not supported now.

  - CompactFlash(R)
  - SD Memory Card
  - FOOT SW

  The wireless feature (Bluetooth(R)/Wireless LAN) can only be used 
  on Reference Tools DEH-R1040 and later, which have the necessary 
  authorization tools.
  The antenna for the wireless feature is bundled with DEH-1040 and 
  later Reference Tools. Do not attempt to connect DEH-R1030 and 
  earlier Reference Tools.

- For specifications regarding the Reference Tool, please refer to 
  info/Reference_System-Supplement_*.pdf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
CBE Specifications
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Currently, the CBE that is equipped with each tool version can use 
  six SPUs. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Software(GUI) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Since a change has been made so that a process termination wait occurs 
  when the power off processing is performed in the case of when booted 
  from the debugger, with some of the samples that do not support 
  the termination processing of game applications, a timeout occurs 
  and the system is forcibly terminated with a warning sound when 
  the power off processing is performed in the case of when booted from 
  the debugger. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Utilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Web Browser Utility>
- Files cannot be downloaded with the downloader. 

<On-Screen Keyboard Utility>
- The optional dictionary feature is not supported. 

< Photo Utility >
- Only the "export function" to the photo column of the system software 
  is supported. 
  "import function" and "decode function" from the photo column of 
  the system software will be supported in the future. 

- When cellPhotoExportFinalize() is executed immediately after 
  a photo file is registered in the system software by executing 
  cellPhotoExportFromFile(), the application may hang up. 

< Save Data Utility >
(Added in Version 181.001)
- The save data utility that runs on the SDK180 system software returns 
  an incorrect error value instead of a specific value that should have been 
  returned. 

  The applicable functions are as shown below:
  cellSaveDataListSave2()
  cellSaveDataListLoad2()
  cellSaveDataFixedSave2()
  cellSaveDataFixedLoad2()
  cellSaveDataAutoSave2()
  cellSaveDataAutoLoad2()
  cellSaveDataListAutoSave()
  cellSaveDataListAutoLoad()

< Message Dialog Utility >
(Added in Version 181.001)
- When the progress bar related API of the message dialog utility 
  is called, the processing may be blocked for a long time.

< Subdisplay Utility >
(Added in Version 181.001)
- The following constant is not defined in the header. 
  target/ppu/include/sysutil/sysutil_subdisplay.h
  #define CELL_SUBDISPLAY_ERROR_ZERO_REGISTERED ( 0x80029813 )

  This will be added to the next release.
  Note that the following constant will be left to keep the compatibility:
  target/ppu/include/sysutil/sysutil_subdisplay.h
  #define CELL_REMOTEPLAY_ERROR_ZERO_REGISTERED ( 0x80029813 )

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BD Emulator (HDD)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When using the BD emulator on Windows, dtcfsutil.exe does not operate 
  on the msys. Please use dtcfsutil.exe on the command prompt. 
  There is no problem when using the BD emulator on Linux.
  Also note that the above restriction is applied when formatting the 
  HDD format for the BD emulator.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
File System
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<cellftp>
- The -u option of the put command does not work correctly.

- Although the option -u of the copy command or the copydir command 
  is specified, it does not work correctly if the copy destination is HOSTFS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libftp
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Transfer speeds start to slow significantly once more than two
  simultaneous transfer streams are employed.

- It may fail to make a connection with Internet Explorer 6.0.

- Passive transfer mode (PASV) is currently not supported.

- Rename commands (RNFR/RNTO) are currently not supported.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cell OS Lv-2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- If you try to create upper limit or more memory containers with 
  sys_memory_container_create(), an ID that is the same as that of 
  the memory container that has already been allocated is returned 
  for a new memory container. When this occurs, the older memory 
  container may not be destroyed with sys_memory_container_destroy() 
  and may not be retrieved by the system even at the time of game 
  process termination. 

  [Workaround]
  Please make sure that the number of memory containers to be created 
  with a game process at the same time is less than 10. 

(Added in Version 181.001)
- When 32 PRXs are loaded and the game process is terminated without 
  unloading the PRXs, it is unable to terminate it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfont
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The vertical rendering function does not support the Chinese character
  positioning.
  Also, it does not replace the 2-byte () and {} into the vertical 
  character codes when vertical character displacement is performed 
  internally.
  To avoid this problem, directly specify the vertical character codes 
  or use the single-byte () and {}.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard C/C++ Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- If the following compile options are specified when compiling 
  a program on the PPU side, many warnings may be output. 

  -Wall -Wundef -Wundef -Wsystem-headers -Wcast-qual

- When compiling an SPU program that included math.h, an error occurs 
  if -fsingle-precision-constant is specified as the compile option. 

- When including the system header, include it outside extern "C" or 
  extern "C++". 

  For example, an error may occur if a program such as below is compiled:

    extern "C" {
      ...

      #include <yyyy> // NG : Including within extern "C". 

      ...
    }

  The error can be avoided by rewriting the program as shown below: 

    #include <yyyy>
    extern "C" {

      ... 

    }

<PPU>
- There are following limitations on the usage of atexit function.

  * If a function in a PRX module is registered using atexit function,
    and if main function finishes or exit function is invoked after the 
    PRX module is stopped, a DSI (data storage interrupt) will occur.

  * If atexit function is used in a C++ global constructor, the behavior 
    is different from the C++ standard.  All the registered functions are 
    invoked prior to all the global destructors.

<PPU>
- If you use class ios_base or any of its derived classes (fstream,
  iostream, stringstream, strstream, etc.) in PRX, create their 
  instances in ELF, and pass the pointers to them to PRX.  If they are 
  created in PRX, a DSI (data storage interrupt) may occur in function 
  _Fac_tidy() at the termination of the PPU program.

<SPU>
- If very large amount of stack or heap area is used, heap area may be 
  destroyed.  SPU ABI allows accessing memory at negative offsets from 
  stack pointer up to -2000 as well as positive offsets, but using 
  negative offsets is not guaranteed in some cases due to a bug.
  Negative offsets from stack pointer are used in spu_printf(), leaf 
  functions, etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Vector Math
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- A function of the Vector Math library, that calculates the square 
  root or the inverse number of the square root, does not meet the 
  operation accuracy of the IEEE float type standard.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libcamera
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When other USB devices are attached/detached, a few video frames 
  may be lost during the transition.

- Restrictions on the USB Video Class (UVC) Camera
  1. Does not support a UVC camera that is not compliant with the UVC 
     even though it is USB 2.0 compliant. 
  2. Does not support a camera that has no streaming function.
  3. Does not support a camera that is connected via the USB 1.1 hub.
  4. Does not support the mirror function. 
  5. Support only a single camera.
  6. EyeToy USB Camera(for PlayStation 2) is given a higher priority 
     when it is connected. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmic
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The system echo-canceller does not support USB loudspeaker. 
  Audio chat may suffer echo feedback or howling if chat outputs 
  to USB loudspeaker.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libusbd
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When connecting or disconnecting a device to a USB port of the 
  machine body, other USB devices already connected may be 
  disconnected or may have an impact on its data communication.
  To avoid these problems, connect a self power hub to one of the USB 
  ports of the machine body.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
MultiStream
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In Time Domain only mode, ADPCM data at low sample rates (< 24khz) 
  can cause noise

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Host File Server dtcfilesv
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In host-win32/dtcfilesv.exe, the value of the directory information 
  d_namlen obtained by executing cellFsReaddir() toward the HOSTFS 
  does not match with the value in d_name. 
  This problem occurs only with the Windows version of dtcfilesv command.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libperf
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the Lv-2 system call trace is enabled with the back trace 
  on the program that is linked with libperf.a of SDK170 or before, 
  it does not work on the target system that is updated to SDK 180 and later.
  (applicable to libperf/ppu sample)
  Please use libperf.a that is released after SDK 180.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SPU Runtime Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<libspurs task>
- In the SPURS lock free queue, when the following functions are called 
  from multiple PPU threads at the same time, an error is not returned: 
  cellSpursLFQueuePush()
  cellSpursLFQueuePop()
  Do not call them from multiple PPU threads at the same time, 
  otherwise any one of the PPU threads may not return from the above function.

- It is not allowed by the specifications to attach the event queue to 
  the SPURS lock free queue that is initialized for SPU-SPU communication.
  However, cellSpursLFQueueAttachLv2EventQueue() function returns CELL_OK 
  for such operation. 

  Note that when the same operation is performed in SDK170 or before, 
  cellSpursLFQueueAttachLv2EventQueue() function returns the error code 
  CELL_SPURS_TASK_ERROR_PERM.

  This bug will be fixed in the future SDK. Do not execute 
  cellSpursLFQueueAttachLv2EventQueue() function for the SPURS lock free queue 
  that is initialized for SPU-SPU communication. 

<libspurs job>
- In Job 2.0, when executing a job that is built by specifying the alignment 
  size that exceeds 16 bytes for the text section within the job module source,
  the following functions return CELL_SPURS_JOB_ERROR_PERM. 
  - cellSpursJoinJobChain()
  - cellSpursJobChainGetError()

- When handling the JOBLIST command processing, the following processing 
  of the SPURS kernel and the system service are not executed. 

  - Preemption of the workload (Transfer the execution right to other workload)
  - Add and shutdown the workload
  - Change the workload priority
  - Initialize and discard the SPURS trace 

  Due to this problem, on the SPU that grabs the first "maxGrabbedJob" 
  number of the JOBLIST command jobs, theses processing delays until 
  the execution of all the grabbed jobs are completed.

  Note that maxGrabbedJob is an argument specified by 
  cellSpursJobChainAttributeInitialize() or cellSpursCreateJobChain() 
  and indicates the maximum number of jobs that a single SPU can 
  grab at a time.  

(Added in Version 181.001)
- The inline function of the SPU cellSpursJobGetPointerList() does not return 
  CELL_OK correctly.
  It returns an appropriate error code in the case of an error, however 
  an undefined value is returned instead of CELL_OK when it ended normally. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm_tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The windows version of libgcm_tool is available only with VisualStudio2005. 
  Also note that the sample project file is created using VisualStudio2005.
  Both the library and the sample are not compliant with VisualStudio2003.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libsail
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The user defined resource feature is currently handled as 
  a beta version. 
  When submitting a master disc using this user defined source feature, 
  please make sure to switch to libsail that includes the official version. 

(Added in Version 181.001)
- When the PAMF file header exceeds 2KB, the movie playback 
  using libsail may hang up in mid-flow.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Commerce
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added in Version 181.001)
- sceNpCommerceGetProductCategoryStart() does not behave correctly when 
  CELL_SYSUTIL_LANG_CHINESE_T is specified to the 3rd argument "lang_code". 

(Added in Version 181.001)
- The following 4 language codes cannot be specified to the third argument 
  "lang_code" of sceNpCommerceGetProductCategoryStart():

  CELL_SYSUTIL_LANG_FINNISH (12) Finish
  CELL_SYSUTIL_LANG_SWEDISH (13) Swedish
  CELL_SYSUTIL_LANG_DANISH  (14) Danish
  CELL_SYSUTIL_LANG_NORWEGIAN (15) Norwegian 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Signaling
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added in Version 181.001)
- From SDK 180 onwards, the following macros can be specified to 
  the argument "code" of sceNpSignalingGetConnectionInfo(): 

    SCE_NP_SIGNALING_CONN_INFO_BANDWIDTH   Estimated bandwidth (byte/second) 
    SCE_NP_SIGNALING_CONN_INFO_PEER_NPID   NP ID of a peer

  In sceNpSignalingGetConnectionInfo() section of the NP Signaling 
  Reference document, it describes that only SCE_NP_SIGNALING_CONN_INFO_RTT 
  can be specified, but this description is wrong.
  From SDK 180 onwards, all 3 macros are available.
