GCC

<PPU/SPU>
(B#55075)
- When casting between two different pointers to structs, one with a
  field of a vector type and one does not, can cause an internal
  compiler error in expand_expr_real_1. This has been fixed.
  "xxxx.cpp:(xx): internal compiler error: in expand_expr_real_1, at expr.c:7665"

(B#56742)
- With mutliple compiles running at the same time on the same machine
  with PreCompiled Headers on, an internal error in MapViewOfFileEx
  would happen. This has been fixed.
  "internal error in mingw32_gt_pch_use_address,
   at config/i386/host-mingw32.c(177): MapViewOfFileEx: Access is denied."

(B#56742)
- When compiling with PreCompiled Headers on, an internal error in
  VirtualAlloc would happen. This has been fixed.
  "internal error in mingw32_gt_pch_get_address,
   at config/i386/host-mingw32.c(119): VirtualAlloc: Attempt to access invalid address."

(B#57220)
- When a type is defined(typedef) in a template, the debug
  information was not generated correctly.
  This problem has been fixed.

(B#57679)
- In some cases with a large number of variables whose address have
  been taken and inlining, GCC would produce wrong code.
  This problem has been fixed.
