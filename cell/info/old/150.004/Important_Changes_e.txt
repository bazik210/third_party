  (CELL_OSKDIALOG_PANELMODE_KOREAN) has been added to the input panels
  to be specified with the member allowOskPanelFlg of the structure 
  CellOskDialogParam. 

- A function for adding a panel (language) to be supported by

Message Dialog Utility
======================
<New Feature>
- The following function, which has been obtained by adding features 
  to the conventional function, has been added:  
    cellMsgDialogOpen2() 
  The basic method of using it is the same as the conventional function,
  but the following dialog features have been added.  
  The conventional function will be left for compatibility, but please 
  use the above function in a title application..
    - Sound effects upon dialog startup
    - Button types

  The conventional functions will be left for compatibility, 
  but please use the above functions in a title application. 
    - Perform the processing till the end, even when the power is 
      turned off. 
    - Specify the user specified data (void *userdata) to be passed to
      various callbacks.  
      However, for cellSaveDataDelete2(), there is no userdata since 
      there is no callback. 
    - When called from different threads at the same time, return 
      CELL_SAVEDATA_ERROR_BUSY and terminate the function that was called
      later. 

- Functions for performing autosave/autoload in procedures similar to 
  those of fixed save/fixed load have been added.

  of the video chat participant screen from the title application side.  
    cellSysutilAvcExtSetWindowPosition() 
    cellSysutilAvcExtGetWindowPosition() 
    cellSysutilAvcExtSetWindowRotation() 
    cellSysutilAvcExtGetWindowRotation()

  utility extension module must be loaded. 

- cellSysutilAvcExtGetSurfacePointer() has been added so as to be able
  to get the video data that is played in a video chat from the title 
  application side. With this feature, it has become possible to process 
  the video and display it freely on the title application side. 
  When using this in a title application, the AV chat utility extension 
  module must be loaded. 

<Sample Change> (samples/sysutil/avc)

  the display position, size, etc. of the video chat participant screen 
  from the title application side and the feature of getting the video data
  that is played in a video chat from the title application side are used. 

System Cache Utility
====================
<New Feature>
- A function for initializing the system cache area that has just 
  be mounted, cellSysCacheClear(), has been added. When the title 
  application finds an error in an existing file while using the system
  cache and wants to destroy the whole system cache, it is possible to 
  clear the contents of the cache partition without changing the cache ID.
  For details, please refer to "System Cache Utility Reference" and 
  "System Cache Utility Overview". 

- The feature of determining if the system cache area is broken 
  at the time of mounting  the system cache area has been supported. 
  For details, please refer to "System Cache Utility Overview". 

<Sample Change> (samples/sysutil/syscache)

  that are comparatively small, it has become possible to output 1080i and
  1080p. The filter that is used when expanding is equivalent to bilinear.
  According to this, title applications have become possible to output 
  1080p/1080i with less memory and rendering cost.  
    1600x1080 
    1440x1080 
    1280x1080 
    960x1080

- As a constant that represents the video output port, a macro constant
  that indicates the output to 
  the network device (PSP(TM) (PlayStation(R)Portable)), 
  CELL_VIDEO_OUT_PORT_NETWORK, has been added.  
  The current SDK does not support the function of 
  CELL_VIDEO_OUT_PORT_NETWORK, which will be officially included 
  in the future version upgrade. 

<Specification Change>
- According to the addition of the feature that is related to the output
  of 1080p/1080i, the specification has been changed. When the information
  of the video output device was obtained with cellVideoOutGetDeviceInfo(),
  the resolution of the structure CellVideoOutDeviceInfo was the value that
  was obtained by converting the hardware scaler from 1280x720 to 1920x1080.
  However, a change has been made so that this conversion will not 
  be performed. 

<Sample Change> (samples/sysutil/video/resolution)
- It has been changed so as to use the resolutions 1600x1080, 1440x1080,
  1280x1080, 960x1080, and 720x576. 

Audio Setting Utility
=====================
<New Feature>
- As a constant that represents the audio output port, a macro constant 
  that indicates the output to 
  the network device (PSP(TM) (PlayStation(R)Portable)), 
  CELL_AUDIO_OUT_PORT_NETWORK, has been added.  
  The current SDK does not support the function of CELL_AUDIO_OUT_PORT_NETWORK,
  which will be officially included in the future version upgrade. 

- With the following functions, it has become possible to get the 
  information of when CELL_AUDIO_OUT_SECONDARY is specified with
  the argument audioOut:  
    cellAudioOutGetNumberOfDevice() 
    cellAudioOutGetDeviceInfo() 
    cellAudioOutGetState() 
    cellAudioOutGetSoundAvailability()

<Specification Change>
- When the resolution was changed, the audio setting was reset. 
  However, it has been changed so as to retain the audio setting even 
  when the resolution is changed.
