New Additions and Changes in Release 131.002
----------------------------------------------------------------------
GCC
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- To support the SN Systems compiler, the header file configuration of 
  the intrinsics to be installed under cell/ of the SDK package has 
  been changed. 
  This configuration ensures the source compatibility with the GCC 
  compiler, therefore, no action is required by the application 
  program side. Changed items are as shown below:

  - The following intrinsics header files for GCC have been changed 
    to *_gcc.h:
    <PPU>
    target/ppu/include/ppu_intrinsics.h
      -> target/ppu/include/ppu_intrinsics_gcc.h
    target/ppu/include/spu2vmx.h
      -> target/ppu/include/spu2vmx_gcc.h
    target/ppu/include/si2vmx.h
      -> target/ppu/include/si2vmx_gcc.h
    <SPU>
    target/spu/include/spu_intrinsics.h
      -> target/spu/include/spu_intrinsics_gcc.h
    target/spu/include/spu_mfcio.h
      -> target/spu/include/spu_mfcio_gcc.h
    target/spu/include/vmx2spu.h
      -> target/spu/include/vmx2spu_gcc.h

  - In order to remove the differences between the GCC and the SN 
    Systems compilers, the following wrapper header files have been 
    added in the SDK package.:
    <PPU>
    target/ppu/include/ppu_intrinsics.h
    target/ppu/include/spu2vmx.h
    target/ppu/include/si2vmx.h
    <SPU>
    target/spu/include/spu_intrinsics.h
    target/spu/include/spu_mfcio.h
    target/spu/include/vmx2spu.h
