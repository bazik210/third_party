----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Utilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Save Data Utility>
- When a save data for "PS3" was being copied from an external 
  storage with the lock on to HDD, the process could fail. 
  This problem has been fixed.

- In samples/sysutil/savedata, when multiple items matched as a 
  search result of a prefix to be specified for cellSaveDataFixedLoad(),
  it entered into an infinite loop. This problem has been fixed.

- In samples/sysutil/savedata sample, a character string specified to 
  detail has been changed.

- In samples/sysutil/savedata sample, there was a bug in the log that 
  executes printf. This problem has been fixed.

<System Cache Utility>
- In the case where a game was started from the debugger, the unmounting
  process of the system cache area was not performed when the game was 
  terminated and the power was turned off. This problem has been fixed.

<Disc Boot Game Utility>
- When the Save Data Utility and Game Data Utility were called with a 
  disc inserted, a disc insertion event was notified. This problem has 
  been fixed.

<Video Configuration Utility>
- sysutil/video/resolution sample was unable to be build in the ProDG 
  environment. This problem has been fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Entire NP
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In SceNpId structures indicating the same NP account, the content of
  opt handled by NP Basic Utility, NP Manager Utility, NP Matching 
  Utility and NP Signaling Utility, and the one handled by NP Score 
  Ranking Utility differed.

  Consequently, when the SceNpId structure obtained by NP Score 
  Ranking Utility was passed as an argument of NP Basic Utility, NP 
  Manager Utility, NP Matching Utility, NP Signaling Utility, an error 
  could occur.

  Also, when the SceNpId structure obtained by NP Score Ranking 
  Utility and the one obtained by  NP Basic Utility, NP Manager 
  Utility, NP Matching Utility, NP Signaling Utility were compared, 
  SCE_NP_UTIL_ERROR_NOT_MATCH was returned although the same account 
  was indicated.

  These problems have been fixed. No action is required by the 
  application side.

<NP Basic Utility>
- When sceNpBasicRegisterHandler() was called at a specific timing, 
  it was unable to obtain the presence of an offline friend. 
  This problem has been fixed.

<NP Matching Utility>
- If the LAN cable was pulled out at a specific timing (before 
  the completion event of requests from sceNpMatchingSearchJoinRoomGUI() 
  and sceNpMatchingCreateRoomGUI() was notified) while the NP Matching Utility 
  was handling a process to join a room, and then the matching context was 
  deleted by sceNpMatchingDestroyCtx(), the system software could hang up. 
  This problem has been fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libnet
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the DNS cache was used up, the library stopped. This problem 
  has been fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libdbgfont
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In libdbgfont.a for PSGL, when the rendering resolution and the 
  output resolution of an application differed, libdbgfont was unable
  to render with a correct resolution. This problem has been fixed.

- In libdbgfont.a for PSGL and libgcm, when the buffer size was an 
  abnormal value(such as 0 or UINT_MAX), an error handling was not 
  performed correctly. This problem has been fixed.

- In libdbgfont.a for PSGL and libgcm, when a NULL character was
  assigned to cellDbgFontPrintf(), cellDbgFontVprintf(), 
  cellDbgFontConsolePuts(),  cellDbgFontConsolePrintf() and  
  cellDbgFontConsoleVprintf(), an exception error occurred. This 
  problem has been fixed.

- In simple_console_gcm sample, even when the sample path was 
  specified by "$(CELL_SAMPLE_DIR)", it referred to fwgcm sample 
  specified by "$(CELL_SDK)", so that the sample could not be built 
  in a Linux environment. This problem has been fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- A bug described in the Technical Note 200611-01(Bug relating to
  cellGcmMapMainMemory() ) has been fixed.
  Refer to the following Technical Note 200611-01:
  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/363

- When cellSysmoduleUnloadModule(CELL_SYSMODULE_GCM_SYS) is executed, 
  a termination process for an interrupt thread and RSX(TM) are now 
  conducted. Accordingly, DSI and ISI that could be observed when the 
  game application was terminated will no longer occur.

- The following problem has been fixed.

  - Even if cellGcmSetSurface() was executed after specifying 
    CELL_GCM_LOCATION_MAIN for the member depthLocation of the structure 
    CellGcmSurface, the behavior was same as that of when 
    CELL_GCM_LOCATION_LOCAL was specified. 

  Accordingly, when CELL_GCM_LOCATION_MAIN is specified, a depth buffer 
  can be now allocated to the main memory.

- In gcm/Dice sample, FWGCMCamControlApplication::onInit() was not called.
  This problem has been fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
PSGL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- 16 bit texture was converted into 32 bit texture within the library.
  This has been changed so that 16 bit texture is used as is 
  without conversion.

- When the memory is allocated twice within the library using 
  the value specified by the argument of glBufferData() "size", 
  the memory  allocated later was freed in the next frame.
  This has been fixed so that the memory fragmentation is resolved.

- Although an incorrect value was passed to the argument of 
  cgGetString() "sname", CG_INVALID_ENUMERANT_ERROR was not returned.
  This problem has been fixed.

- When an array of a structure was used in a shader program, 
  cgnv2elf set unnecessary default data. This problem has been fixed.

- When cgGetNamedParameter() was executed, an assertion occurred. 
  This problem has been fixed.

- When cgnv2elf was executed, it crashed. 
  This problem has been fixed.

- When a parameter with not semantics was passed to cgGetParameterSemantic(), 
  a NULL pointer was returned. This problem has been fixed 
  so that an empty character string is returned.

- When a sample program was built using PSGL HUD, it hung up or crashed. 
  This problem has been fixed.

- When "w" key was pressed while the "Call View" menu of the PSGL HUD library 
  was being displayed, a DSI occurred. 
  This problem has been fixed.

- In the following sample program, spu_add() is now used to add 
  vec_uint4 types.
  samples/graphics/SpecialFeatures/VideoTexturingSPU/spu.c 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard C/C++ Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<PPU>
- In ppu/include/bits/exp2f4.h and ppu/include/bits/logbf4.h, there 
  was an error in the vector literal description. This problem has been 
  fixed.

- ppu/include/alloca.h and ppu/include/stddef.h have been modified so 
  that it now supports the SN Systems' compiler.

- In ppu/include/fastmath.h, a macro was defined duplicatedly. This 
  problem has been fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cell OS Lv-2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The following samples did not work correctly. This problem has been 
  fixed.
  - samples/lv2/cond_var
  - samples/lv2/raw_spu_printf

----------------------------------------------------------------------
CODEC
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<libjpgdec>
- When an error stream that was shorter than the actual data length was
  split-input using a callback in a SPU decode process, the following 
  problem occurred. This problem has been fixed.

  When strmParam.strmSize=0 or strmParam.strmPtr=NULL was set within a 
  callback function, it hung up with cellJpgDecExtReadHeader() or 
  cellJpgDecExtDecodeData().

<libvdec>
- The following problem has been fixed.

  - A problem occurred when calling cellVdecClose() (only with MPEG-2 video). 
    Details: 
    If cellVdecClose() was called just after calling cellVdecDecodeAu(), 
    cellVdecStartSeq(), or cellVdecEndSeq(), the call could stop in 
    cellVdecClose() and could not return in some rare cases. 
    In order to avoid this problem, please call cellVdecEndSeq() before 
    calling cellVdecClose() so that the SEQDONE callback is received 
    for sure before calling cellVdecClose(). 

- When AVC(CELL_VDEC_CODEC_TYPE_AVC) was selected as a CODEC type at
  the time of cellVdecQueryAttr() call, the value of cmdDepth obtained
  was incremented with 1(+1). This problem has been fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libsail
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In streaming/simple_player sample, the following items have been 
  fixed.

  - libsail no longer makes use of 2ch mixdown that uses libmixer
    (to support 5.1/7.1ch).
  - Even when calls of cellSailSoundAdapterGetFrame() and  
    cellSailGraphicsAdapterGetFrame() ended in error, it referred to tag.
    This problem has been fixed.
  - An unnecessary path was contained in the Makefile. This has been 
    deleted.
  - When a file with an extension .pam is searched, it now determines 
    whether it is a directory or a file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libaudio
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In sound/audio/playaudio and sound/audio/play2nd samples, a 
  termination process is now performed for each library, for example,
  cellGcmFinish() is called.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmixer
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In sound/mixer/check8ch, sound/mixer/chstrip, sound/mixer/ssplayer 
  and sound/mixer/surbus, a termination process is now performed for 
  each library, for example, cellGcmFinish() is called.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
libsynth2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In sound/synth2/whole sample, a termination process is now performed 
  for each library, for example, cellGcmFinish() is called.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libsnd3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In sound/snd3/playsmf and sound/snd3/runhorse samples, a termination 
  process is now performed for each library, for example, 
  cellGcmFinish() is called.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libcamera
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The EyeToy USB Camera (for PlayStation 2) LED was turned off 
  when it's opened first time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmic
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The range of microphone sensitivity setting by the system 
  configuration dialog was narrow.  
  The mapping of sensitivity 1,2,3,4,5 has been changed.

- There was a case that the microphone is closed when user operates 
  the system configuration dialog "Audio Device Settings" while 
  the application has opened and is using the microphone.
  When microphone device is switched by the menu, the application 
  receives DETACH / ATTACH message.  This bug appears when 
  application takes time (such as 500msec) after the ATTACH message 
  until it calls open function. This bug has been fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
USB
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<USB driver>
- When cellUsbdRegisterLdd() and cellUsbdUnregisterLdd() were 
  repeatedly called for a single LDD, it could access an incorrect 
  memory. This problem has been fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
samples/simulation/PhysicsEffects Sample
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- A sample build could fail. This problem has been fixed.
