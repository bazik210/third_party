======================================================================
The following are known bugs, limitations and cautions on 
the Reference Tool SDK package.

New updates have the release version of this package. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reference Tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- A problem has been found that when a program that outputs voice 
  from RSX(TM) is activated, and then one of the following is 
  performed, voice is not output.
  - Plug-in/out the HDMI cable
  - Switch the TV monitor power from Off to On (including the AV Amp)
  - Switch between the TV monitor channels and set the HDMI input again
    (including the AV Amp)

- The following devices are not supported now.

  - CompactFlash(R)
  - SD Memory Card
  - FOOT SW

  The wireless feature (Bluetooth(R)/Wireless LAN) can only be used 
  on Reference Tools DEH-R1040 and later, which have the necessary 
  authorization tools.
  The antenna for the wireless feature is bundled with DEH-1040 and 
  later Reference Tools. Do not attempt to connect DEH-R1030 and 
  earlier Reference Tools.

- For specifications regarding the Reference Tool, please refer to 
  info/Reference_System-Supplement_*.pdf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
CBE Specifications
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Currently, the CBE that is equipped with each tool version can use 
  six SPUs. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Software(GUI) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Since a change has been made so that a process termination wait occurs 
  when the power off processing is performed in the case of when booted 
  from the debugger, with some of the samples that do not support 
  the termination processing of game applications, a timeout occurs 
  and the system is forcibly terminated with a warning sound when 
  the power off processing is performed in the case of when booted from 
  the debugger. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Utilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Web Browser Utility>
- Files cannot be downloaded with the downloader. 

- When an image is decoded using the heap area for contents close to 
  the upper limit, it may hang up.

- The handler onMouseOver/onMouseOut of JavaScript does not work 
  properly. Use onFocus/onBlur instead.

- The performance may be slow when using ClickableMap.

<On-Screen Keyboard Utility>
- The optional dictionary feature is not supported. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BD Emulator (HDD)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When using the BD emulator on Windows, dtcfsutil.exe does not operate 
  on the msys. Please use dtcfsutil.exe on the command prompt. 
  There is no problem when using the BD emulator on Linux.
  Also note that the above restriction is applied when formatting the 
  HDD format for the BD emulator.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
File System
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<cellftp>
- The -u option of the put command does not work correctly.

- Although the option -u of the copy command or the copydir command 
  is specified, it does not work correctly if the copy destination is HOSTFS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libftp
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Transfer speeds start to slow significantly once more than two
  simultaneous transfer streams are employed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cell OS Lv-2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- If you try to create upper limit or more memory containers with 
  sys_memory_container_create(), an ID that is the same as that of 
  the memory container that has already been allocated is returned 
  for a new memory container. When this occurs, the older memory 
  container may not be destroyed with sys_memory_container_destroy() 
  and may not be retrieved by the system even at the time of game 
  process termination. 

  [Workaround]
  Please make sure that the number of memory containers to be created 
  with a game process at the same time is less than 10. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
CODEC
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<libvdec>
- It is assumed that the outputs of the samples are output to 
  a PC monitor with a resolution of SXGA or more or to an HDMI monitor 
  that supports 1280x720/60p input.
  Therefore, if the monitor setting is not performed appropriately 
  in advance with the setmonitor utility, the samples will display 
  an warning message. 

<libdmux>
- When calling cellDmuxDisableEs(), please make sure that the video/audio 
  decoder is not decoding the applicable ES (Elementary Stream) before 
  calling. 
  Specifically, it is recommended to call cellDmuxDisableEs() after 
  CELL_VDEC_MSG_TYPE_AUDONE/CELL_ADEC_MSG_TYPE_AUDONE for the AU input 
  to the video/audio decoder is received or after 
  cellVdecClose()/cellAdecClose() is called. 

<libvpost>
- It is assumed that the outputs of the samples are output to 
  a PC monitor with a resolution of SXGA or more or to an HDMI monitor 
  that supports 1280x720/60p input. Therefore, if the monitor setting 
  is not performed appropriately in advance with the setmonitor utility, 
  the samples will display an error message and will be aborted. 

<libjpgdec>
- It is assumed that the outputs of the samples are output to 
  a PC monitor with a resolution of SXGA or more or to an HDMI monitor 
  that supports 1280x720/60p input. Therefore, if the monitor setting 
  is not performed appropriately in advance with the setmonitor utility, 
  the samples will display an error message and will be aborted. 

<libpngdec>
- It is assumed that the outputs of the samples are output to 
  a PC monitor with a resolution of SXGA or more or to an HDMI monitor 
  that supports 1280x720/60p input. Therefore, if the monitor setting 
  is not performed appropriately in advance with the setmonitor utility, 
  the samples will display an error message and will be aborted. 

- The following bug occurs when decoding a stream whose info->colorSpace value,
  obtained by CellPngDecInfo *info argument of cellPngDecReadHeader(), is 
  either CELL_PNGDEC_GRAYSCALE_ALPHA or CELL_PNGDEC_RGBA: 

  When inParam->outputAlphaSelect is set to CELL_PNGDEC_FIX_ALPHA in the 
  CellPngDecInParam *inParam argument of cellPngDecSetParameter(), the fixed 
  alpha value set to inParam->outputColorAlpha is not output to the decode 
  image, but the alpha value of the stream is output instead. 

- The following problem occurs when decoding a stream whose info->colorSpace 
  value, obtained by CellPngDecInfo *info argument of cellPngDecReadHeader(), 
  is CELL_PNGDEC_PALETTE, and whose bit, that indicates the existence of 
  the tRNS chunk of info->chunkInformation, is set to 1:

  When a value other than CELL_PNGDEC_PALETTE is set to 
  inParam->outputColorSpace using CellPngDecInParam *inParam argument of 
  cellPngDecSetParameter(), the values of trns->alphaForPaletteIndex and 
  trns->alphaForPaletteIndexNumber, that are obtained by CellPngTRNS *trns 
  argument of cellPngDecGettRNS(), are set to 0. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfont
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the glyph information generated by a glyph information 
  acquisition function, and the size and the aspect ratio specified to 
  the function that renders based on the glyph information differ 
  significantly, the following problem may occur:

  cellFontGlyphRenderImageVertical() function that renders vertically 
  based on the glyph information cannot render in the correct positions.

- The vertical rendering function does not support the Chinese character
  positioning.
  Also, it does not replace the 2-byte () and {} into the vertical 
  character codes when vertical character displacement is performed 
  internally.
  To avoid this problem, directly specify the vertical character codes 
  or use the single-byte () and {}.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard C/C++ Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- If the following compile options are specified when compiling 
  a program on the PPU side, many warnings may be output. 

  -Wall -Wundef -Wundef -Wsystem-headers -Wcast-qual

- When compiling an SPU program that included math.h, an error occurs 
  if -fsingle-precision-constant is specified as the compile option. 

- When including the system header, include it outside extern "C" or 
  extern "C++". 

  For example, an error may occur if a program such as below is compiled:

    extern "C" {
      ...

      #include <yyyy> // NG : Including within extern "C". 

      ...
    }

  The error can be avoided by rewriting the program as shown below: 

    #include <yyyy>
    extern "C" {

      ... 

    }

<PPU>
- There are following limitations on the usage of atexit function.

  * If a function in a PRX module is registered using atexit function,
    and if main function finishes or exit function is invoked after the 
    PRX module is stopped, a DSI (data storage interrupt) will occur.

  * If atexit function is used in a C++ global constructor, the behavior 
    is different from the C++ standard.  All the registered functions are 
    invoked prior to all the global destructors.

<PPU>
- If you use class ios_base or any of its derived classes (fstream,
  iostream, stringstream, strstream, etc.) in PRX, create their 
  instances in ELF, and pass the pointers to them to PRX.  If they are 
  created in PRX, a DSI (data storage interrupt) may occur in function 
  _Fac_tidy() at the termination of the PPU program.

<SPU>
- If very large amount of stack or heap area is used, heap area may be 
  destroyed.  SPU ABI allows accessing memory at negative offsets from 
  stack pointer up to -2000 as well as positive offsets, but using 
  negative offsets is not guaranteed in some cases due to a bug.
  Negative offsets from stack pointer are used in spu_printf(), leaf 
  functions, etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SPU Runtime Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<libspurs task>
- When cellSpursWaitSignal function is called from a task in which a 
  context area is not set, an error code CELL_SPURS_TASK_ERROR_STAT 
  should be returned as specified, however, when a signal exists in 
  the task, CELL_OK is always returned incorrectly.

<libspurs policy module>
(Added in Version 170.003)
- cellSpursShutdownWorkload() for SPU returns an error for a workload 
  which has already requested shutdown. 

- cellSpursModuleTrace() that is described in 
  cell/target/spu/include/cell/spurs/policy_module.h is not supported 
  at the moment. It will be deleted from the header file. 

<libdaisy>
(Added in Version 170.003)
- With the following classes, when dmaTagRangeMask is set, the range of 
  DMA tags that will be used correctly cannot be specified: 
   Buffer::Remote,Buffer::StrideRemote,QueueControl::SignalNotification

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Vector Math
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- A function of the Vector Math library, that calculates the square 
  root or the inverse number of the square root, does not meet the 
  operation accuracy of the IEEE float type standard.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libcamera
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When other USB devices are attached/detached, a few video frames 
  may be lost during the transition.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmic
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The system echo-canceller does not support USB loudspeaker. 
  Audio chat may suffer echo feedback or howling if chat outputs 
  to USB loudspeaker.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
USB
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<USB Driver>
- When connecting or disconnecting a device to a USB port of the 
  machine body, other USB devices already connected may be 
  disconnected or may have an impact on its data communication.
  To avoid these problems, connect a self power hub to one of the USB 
  ports of the machine body.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cg Compiler
---------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added in Version 170.003)
- When generating a cgb file, the matrix parameter within the fragment 
  shader was not correctly handled.
