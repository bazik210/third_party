======================================================================
The following are known bugs, limitations and cautions on 
the Reference Tool SDK package.

New updates have the release version of this package. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reference Tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- For specifications regarding the Reference Tool, please refer to 
  SDK_doc\jp(en)\pdf\development_basic\Reference_System-Supplement_*.pdf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Software
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Check menu in the Game column>
- Validation of a media or the file system itself cannot be performed 
  from the Check menu in the Game column.

  When submitting a master disc, make sure to verify the disc that no error
  is present using the Disc Image Generator for PLAYSTATION(R)3 or
  the Disc Image Checker for PLAYSTATION(R)3.

- When performing the check from the Check menu in the Game column, 
  if the number of result files exceeds approximately 80 to 100 depending 
  on each check item, the file entries of the root directory in the USB 
  mass storage run out and the subsequent check result files may no 
  longer be stored.
  In such case, move the check result files to another directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Utilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Game Update Utility>
-  When the Reference Tool is booted having "Debugger mode" specified to
   "Boot parameters" using the Administration Tool or the like,
   the patch distribution feature of the Game Update utility cannot be
   utilized.

<On-Screen Keyboard Utility>
- The optional dictionary feature is not supported.

<Content Search Utility>
- When file paths to the still image and animation thumbnails of content
  are created using cellSearchPrepareFile() and the thumbnails are changed
  from the system software, the changes will not be reflected unless
  cellSearchPrepareFile() is executed again.

<Screenshot Utility>
- The value set to the PNG chunk is stored when it is copied from the 
  system software to an external media (Memory Stick(TM) or such), 
  however, when the stored data is imported into the system software, the 
  value is not reflected to the information screen of the system software.
  This is a current limitation but to be supported in the future system 
  software.

<Background Download utility>
- The following is a notice regarding the behavior of background downloads
  when they are performed while a game application is running.

  Although a background download will usually continue while a game
  application is running, it will be stopped by any one of the following
  conditions.

    - The game application has created more than one socket
    - There is more than one connection that uses the NP signaling utility
    - The AV chat utility or the AV chat 2 utility is being used

  The background download will resume once the condition that stopped it
  no longer applies. 
  Please do not create a game application that is dependent on the progress of
  background downloads.

  If new conditions are added to the above list of conditions that stop
  background downloads given the addition of a new utility, or if there are
  any changes regarding this issue, it will be announced in this technote.
  (TechnoteID:200803-15  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/708)

<Audio Configuration Utility>
- In the multi microphone mode, cellAudioInRegisterDevice() is executed with
  an audio input device type preferred by the application specified to the
  argument deviceType in order to resister the audio input device into
  the system.
  When cellAudioInRegisterDevice() is called, the system software
  automatically assign a device number regardless of whether a matching audio
  input device is found or not. Whether the audio input device that has the
  device number is available or not can be checked through polling using
  cellMicIsAttached() of libmic or an event notification from libmic.

  Since a device number is automatically assigned as described above,
  when multiple USB devices(audio input device) of the type that the game
  application prefers are connected to PLAYSTATION(R)3, which device being
  connected to a USB port has which device number cannot be uniquely
  identified.
  In such case, a user interface should be implemented to identify it such
  as by displaying an indicator (volume) or the like on the screen.
  Note that a mechanism that can explicitly assign a device number to
  a specific device will be provided in the future release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmixer
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The sample value to be specified for the argument "samples" of
  cellSurMixerSurBusAddData() must be multiples of 4.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard C/C++ Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<SPU>
- (B#20077) 
  When the new_handler is not set in the C++ library, and failed to allocate
  memory using "new", it enters into the infinite loop.

- If the following compile options are specified when compiling
  a program on the PPU side, many warnings may be output.

  -Wall -Wundef -Wundef -Wsystem-headers -Wcast-qual

- When including the system header, include it outside extern "C" or
  extern "C++".

  For example, an error may occur if a program such as below is compiled:

    extern "C" {
      ...

      #include <yyyy> // NG : Including within extern "C".

      ...
    }

  The error can be avoided by rewriting the program as shown below:

    #include <yyyy>
    extern "C" {

      ... 

    }

<PPU>
- When starting up a program in which <iostream> is included, the constructor
  of iostream will call the new operator. When you want to avoid calling
  "new" before executing the main function, do not use iostream.

(Added to Release 270.001)
- (B#63770)
  When using libcs.a and specifying a value more than 2GB (0x80000000)
  to the third argument "n" for the following functions, the calculation
  is not made correctly.
   - memcmp
   - strncasecmp
   - strncmp
   - strncat

(Added to Release 270.001)
<PPU>
- (B#67636)
  When using libcs.a, strncasecmp() may not treat the third argument "n"
  correctly as the number of elements to compare.

(Added to Release 270.001)
<PPU>
- (B#69368)
  The abort() function in stdlib.h has a problem, which includes a null 
  character in the string of the call stack information printed to the TTY 
  before the process termination.
  If, for example, one of the following tools is used, the call stack 
  information may not be printed correctly.
   ProDG Target Manager for PLAYSTATION(R)3
   ProDG Debugger for PLAYSTATION(R)3
   Tuner for PLAYSTATION(R)3
  To avoid the issue, if e.g. Target Manager is used, please set "Unknown ESC" 
  to "Hide" in TTY channel shortcut menu.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libsail
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When playing back a PAMF file, few frames(1 to 3 frames) at the end of
  a stream cannot be obtained.

- Only the playback of a MP4 file that is placed on the built-in HDD is 
  guaranteed. Do not embed a source code that plays back other types of 
  MP4 file in the application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Custom Theme
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the effect sound data is too long, the sound may be interrupted 
  at a specific stage. Please refer to the "Custom Theme Specifications" 
  document for more details.

(Added to Release 270.001)
- In SDK270, since the theme file that contains RAF(Rich Appearance Format) 
  is a beta version, it can be used only on the Reference Tool and 
  the system software of the Debugging Station.
  Since it does not work on the system software of PLAYSTATION(R)3 , 
  if you want to confirm the combination with all the icons, please wait 
  until it is officially released.

(Added to Release 270.001)
- When a background in the RAF format is applied and 
  [Settings] column -> [Theme Settings] -> [Background] -> [Brightness] is 
  set to a value other than "Normal", the background may be displayed with 
  the standard brightness for a moment when terminating some applications 
  such as the video.

Notes:
(Added to Release 270.001)
- The [BD/DVD Settings] menu in the [Settings] column has been renamed 
  to [Video Settings] menu in the system software 250 and later. 
  However, the icon ID that is used within the theme compiler should be 
  specified with "icon_bdvd_setting" as before.

(Added to Release 270.001)
- When a background in the RAF format is applied and the Internet browser 
  is activated, the standard background is displayed for a moment. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
liblv2dbg
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 270.001 )
- The context acquisition function of the SPU thread 
  sys_dbg_read_spu_thread_context() can acquire only the lower 32 bits 
  out of 128 bits of the FPSCR (Floating Point Status and Control Register) 
  value. 
  Also, only 32 bits of that value is defined to the FPSCR member of the 
  SPU thread context information structure sys_dbg_spu_thread_context_t 
  that is specified in sys_dbg_read_spu_thread_context().

  To work around this problem, use sys_dbg_read_spu_thread_context2() and
  sys_dbg_spu_thread_context2_t that have been newly added to SDK 270 
  instead.
  
  Note that sys_dbg_read_spu_thread_context() and 
  sys_dbg_spu_thread_context_t will be removed from the SDK in the future.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfont
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The vertical rendering function does not support the Chinese character
  positioning.
  Also, it does not replace the 2-byte () and {} into the vertical
  character codes when vertical character displacement is performed
  internally.
  To avoid this problem, directly specify the vertical character codes
  or use the single-byte () and {}.

- The function for vertical writing does not support the proportional
  vertical writing layout.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfs
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- As a part of the reduction in the memory usage of the system software
  in SDK220, the amount of memory that is used by the file system by
  default has been reduced.
  Due to this change, the performance may be degraded slightly as
  compared to SDK21x when data is written and read in finer units (16KB
  or less). Also, when multiple file accesses are made from multiple
  threads at the same time, the request processing time may slightly
  increase.
  Adding memory from the application using cellFsSetIoBuffer() or other 
  APIs that are newly added could improve but also degrade the performance.
  Be sure to check the performance before you introduce the method.

- When the number of files to open at the same
  time in the CFS(SYS_DEV_HDD0) exceeds the upper limit, an error is
  returned from SDK220 onwards.
  Please be noted that when you update SDK21x to SDK220, an error that
  was not returned previously may be observed.

- (B#47766)
  A bug has been found that blocks the file operation permanently
  after you specify 0 for the file size at calling cellFsTruncate()
  or cellFsFtruncate() for the /dev_hdd0.
  (TechnoteID:200804-07 https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/716)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cell OS Lv-2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The PPU program whose stack size is set to 4KB by
  SYS_PROCESS_PARAM can not be executed because a DSI occurs before
  the main function is called.

  [Workaround]
  Please set the stack size of a Primary PPU Thread to 8 KB or more.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
dt Command
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When boot=dbg is set using a dtcparam that is provided in SDK192 or
  before and the boot parameter is displayed using the dtcparam command
  in SDK200 or later, boot=unknown is displayed. Reset boot=dbg using the
  dtcparam command in SDK200 or later.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BD Emulator
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The data read time could be 2 times longer than the Blu-ray Disc drive.
  This problem has been fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libftp
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Transfer speeds start to slow significantly once more than two
  simultaneous transfer streams are employed.

- It may fail to make a connection with Internet Explorer 6.0.

- Passive transfer mode (PASV) is currently not supported.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
DECI3 CTRLP
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Because the ProDG Target Manager for PLAYSTATION(R)3 of v250.1 or 
  later uses CTRLP to establish a connection, when the ProDG 
  Target Manager for PLAYSTATION(R)3 is connected with a target, 
  the cell\host-common\samples\ctrlp sample program does not work. 
  When the sample program is started up, it shows "dt_register error" 
  and is terminated. 

  To run the ctrlp sample, disconnect the ProDG Target Manager 
  for PLAYSTATION(R)3.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libperf
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the Lv-2 system call trace is enabled with the back trace
  on the program that is linked with libperf.a of SDK170 or before,
  it does not work on the target system that is updated to SDK 180 and
  later.
  (applicable to libperf\ppu sample)
  Please use libperf.a that is released after SDK 180.

- (B#43808)
  The Tuner for PLAYSTATION(R)3 cannot be used to measure the performance
  of the sample program of libperf because the measurement module on
  the target is utilized.

(Added to Release 270.001)
- In DECR-1400, the external memory for tracing is not implemented. 
  Therefore, the external memory cannot be specified to the trace 
  buffer.
  If it is specified, EPERM (0x80010009) is returned as an error at 
  the time of call to cellPerfAddCBEpm().

  Accordingly, the samples\sdk\libperf\ppu sample will not work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfios
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Updated in Release 270.001)
- To use Edge Zlib or Edge LZMA, you must download and install 
  PLAYSTATION(R)Edge 0.4.3.

(Added to Release 270.001)
- Regardless of whether you are using NPDRM files, libsysutil_np_stub.a 
  has to be linked.

(Added to Release 270.001)
- When accessing NPDRM, FIOS calls sceNpDrmIsAvailable2() internally. 
  For this reason, cellSysutilCheckCallback() must be executed 
  in a separate thread. 
  For more information, please refer to the "NP DRM Reference."

(Added to Release 270.001)
- In the description on the cache-class constructor in the libfios Reference 
  document, it recommends 2048 * 1 MB block for a 2GB disk cache. 
  Creating a 2048 * 1 MB block disk cache, however, results in 
  insufficient disk space for the data management, and the performance may 
  degrade significantly when HDD1 becomes full. For this reason, a disk cache 
  on HDD1 should be 2037 * 1 MB block or less.

(Added to Release 270.001)
- New variables have been added to the following structures:

  fios::scheduler_attr, fios::fios_parameters, fios::opattr_t

  When initializing, either use the respective initializers,
  FIOS_SCHEDULER_ATTR_INITIALIZER, FIOS_PARAMETERS_INITIALIZER, and
  FIOS_OPATTR_INITIALIZER or set the added variables to appropriate
  values.

(Added to Release 270.001)
- libfios Overview states that it is necessary to register a media callback 
  so that FIOS does not perform unlimited retries when a Blu-ray disc is 
  ejected. However, because the default behavior of FIOS has been improved 
  in SDK270, the media callback no longer need to be registered to avoid 
  infinite retries.

(Added to Release 270.001)
- scheduler::closeAllFiles() has been added to SDK270, however it is not 
  described in the libfios Reference document. This API can be used to close 
  all open files when a Blu-ray disc is ejected or the like.

- When creating an archive file, if the file to be archived has the
  same name as the output file, and the -y or --overwrite option is
  specified, the file to be archived is overwritten, and thus becomes
  unrecoverable.

- When scheduler::readDirectory() is called for the directory that is being 
  redirected through overlay, the redirection is not reflected and FIOS 
  attempts to read the directory entry in the original directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- cellGcmSetZcull() cannot set the unbind feature for the Zcull area.
  To set the unbind feature for the Zcull area, use cellGcmUnbindZcull().

- When the tile setting is made for the overlapping areas in RSX(TM) using
  cellGcmSetTile(), the address conversion feature of RSX(TM) will not work
  correctly.

  Accordingly, new functions cellGcmSetTileInfo() and cellGcmBindTile()
  have been added to check whether the tile areas are overlapping.

  Please use cellGcmSetTileInfo(), cellGcmBindTile() and cellGcmUnbindTile()
  instead of cellGcmSetTile() and cellGcmSetInvalidateTile() for future
  development.
  cellGcmSetTile() and cellGcmSetInvalidateTile() will be removed in the
  future release.

- When debug versions of cellGcmSetSurface() and cellGcmSetSurfaceWindow() 
  are used, assertion may be incorrectly raised inside each function. 
  (TechnoteID:200807-25  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/777)

- In gcm samples, we have found an error setting of cellGcmSetViewport().
  However, this does not affect the behavior of the samples.
  (TechnoteID:200808-06  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/785)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SPU Runtime Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<libspurs task>
(Added to Release 270.001)
- (B#69612)
  When a task that is created by calling cellSpursCreateTaskset2() is 
  deleted using  cellSpursDestroyTaskset2(), an internal resource leak 
  occurs.
  In SDK 270, although a task is created using cellSpursCreateTaskset2(), 
  use cellSpursShutdownTaskset() and cellSpursJoinTaskset() to delete 
  the task. This problem will be fixed in the future release.

(Added to Release 270.001)
- cellSpursCreateTask(), cellSpursTaskAttributeInitialize(),
  The buffer for the task context that is specified by cellSpursCreateTask2() 
  has to be 128 byte aligned. However, the current implementation checks only 
  for the 16 byte alignment. 
  This problem will be fixed in the future release.

<libovis>
(Added to Release 270.001)
- The trace data is not output correctly from the libovis_trace.a 
  library file for SPU. Do not use the trace feature in SDK270.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmstream
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The "SNC Release" build configuration for the simple_createdsp_td and 
  dsp_sample samples contain a wrong output filename causing the built 
  executables to fail. 
  The samples can be executed by changing the executable names to output 
  from ".self" to ".elf" through the project property.

- The maximum size of a single DSP page will be limited to 12 KB.
  When using the DSP function, the length of the file size that is 
  specified to filesize must not exceed 12KB.
  Note that the maximum size of a single DSP page is defined by 
  CELL_MS_DSP_PAGESIZE in mstream.h. 

- cellMSSystemConfigureSysUtil() is to be deleted in the future.
  Please migrate to cellMSSystemConfigureSysUtilEx(), that has been added
  to SDK200.002, in the game application.

- In Time Domain only mode, ADPCM data at low sample rates (< 24khz)
  can cause noise.

- When each sample is compiled using the SNC compiler, the sample data may not
  be loaded correctly because the environment variable CELL_SDK is used in
  the sample data path.

  When the CELL_SDK is defined with a path other than "\usr\local\cell\",
  it is required to alter the SAMPLE_CELL_SDK path in the sample source
  according to the environment.

  This problem does not occur when the GCC compiler is used.

(Added to Release 270.001)
- The *.pic file can be found under 
  cell\samples\sdk\sound\multistream\dspeffects, however, use the 
  PPU object file(*.ppu.o), that is located under 
  cell\target\ppu\lib\pic\multistream, in the game application. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
cgc
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 270.001)
- (B#36711)
  CellCgbVertexProgramConfiguration.registerCount may hold an incorrect 
  value for shaders that are compiled with -mle option.

(Added to Release 270.001)
- When using libcgc 2.0 on the target machine, all object files must be
  compiled and linked without using the -fno-exceptions or the -fno-rtti 
  options.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmic
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 270.001)
- The maximum buffer size is better to be 128msec for each microphone.
