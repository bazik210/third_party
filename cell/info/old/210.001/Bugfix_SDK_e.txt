  (After change)cellCgbGetVertexAttributeOutputMask()

  Note that both names can be used with SDK210, however,
  cellCgbGetVertexAttributOutputMask() will be removed in SDK220.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- cg.h that is included in gcm_struct.h has been deleted and moved to 
  gcm_spu.h and gcm_tool.h.
  With the PPU version, cg.h is delicately included from gcm.h and 
  gcm_struct.h. This problem has been fixed.

- The following bug has been fixed.

  - A warning message is displayed with the following functions when 
    compiling:
    cellGcmSetConvertSwizzleFormat()
    cellGcmInlineTransfer()
    cellGcmSetDrawArrays()
    cellGcmSetConvertSwizzleFormat()
    cellGcmSetTransferImage()
    cellGcmSetTransferData()
    cellGcmSetTransferImage()
    cellGcmSetTransferData()

- The following bug has been fixed.

  - In cellGcmSetVertexProgramParameter(), when CG_FLOAT, CG_FLOAT1, 
    CG_FLOAT2 or CG_FLOAT3 is specified to the Cg parameter type, memory 
    access is wrongly taken place. 

- In cellGcmSetVertexData4f() and cellGcmSetVertexProgramParameter(), the 
  internal code has been optimized so that an unnecessary LHS does not 
  occur.

- When the debug version of cellGcmSetInlineTransferPointer() and 
  cellGcmSetInlineTransferAlignedPointer() is executed, 
  CELL_GCM_DEBUG_FINISH() is executed internally. Therefore, the command
  is immediately sent to RSX(TM). This problem has been fixed.

- The following bug has been fixed.

  - When cellGcmUnbindZcull() is executed, the unbind setting may not be 
    able to be established correctly.

- The following bug has been fixed.

  - When the following functions end in error, the lightweight mutex, that
    is used internally, is locked and an error code is returned without 
    unlocking it. Therefore, other functions that uses the lightweight 
    mutex cannot be called:

    cellGcmMapMainMemory()
    cellGcmSortRemapEaIoAddress()
    cellGcmMapEaIoAddress()
    cellGcmUnmapIoAddress()
    cellGcmUnmapEaIoAddress()

    Following functions cannot be called because they use the lightweight 
    mutex:
    cellGcmBindZcull()
    cellGcmUnbindZcull()
    cellGcmSetTileInfo()
    cellGcmUnbindTile()

- When using the SN compiler, an error "error 1045-D" occurs when 
  gcm_helper.h is included. This problem has been fixed.
  Also, a declaration "pragma" has been added to gcm_helper.h to avoid 
  this problem.

- The following bug has been fixed.

  - When the samples located under samples/sdk/graphics are built using 
    the SN compiler, many warning messages are displayed.

- The following bug has been fixed.

  - In the samples/sdk/graphics/gcm/zcull sample, the display may be 
    corrupted at execution time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
PSGL
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- When the member variable of the PSGLinitOptions structure is greater 
  than 0 and FALSE(0) is set to the member variable initialzieSPUs, 
  sys_spu_initialize() should be executed explicitly before psglInit().
  However, even when sys_spu_initialize() is not called before psglInit(), 
  an error is not returned. 
  This problem has been fixed so that it asserts within psglInit().

- When the member variable maxSPUs of the PSGLinitOptions structure is 
  set with 0 and psglInit() is executed, the behavior of the PSGL library 
  is not stable. This problem has been fixed. 

  (Example setting)
  PSGLinitOptions.maxSPUs = 0;
  PSGLinitOptions.initializeSPUs = FALSE;
  PSGLinitOptions.enable = PSGL_INIT_INITIALIZE_SPUS | PSGL_INIT_MAX_SPUS;

- When GL_MULTISAMPLING_4X_SQUARE_CENTERED_SCE is specified as the multi 
  sampling mode using the following function, an asset occurs on an irregular 
  base. This problem has been fixed:
  psglCreateDeviceAuto()
  psglCreateDeviceExtended()
  glBufferSurfaceSCE()
  glFramebufferParameteriSCE()

----------------------------------------------------------------------
GTF
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The following bug has been fixed.

  - In dds2gtf, when dds in the G16R16 format is input, it is output 
    using the Y16_X16 format, not D8R8G8B8 format.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libnet
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The following bug has been fixed.

  - (B#44386)
    When establishing a PPPoE connection, if Secondary DNS Server IP 
    Address Option is rejected, an IP address cannot be obtained.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Matching Utility
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The following bug has been fixed.

   - (B#34287)
     On the Reference Tool whose boot parameter is set to the debugger mode, 
     when the game application, that does not have sceNpMatchingDestroyCtx() 
     and sceNpTerm() in the termination processing, is booted and then 
     terminated via "Quit Game" on the termination confirmation dialog that 
     is displayed by holding the PS button down, the NP Matching Utility 
     resource will not be released. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Matching 2 Utility
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The following bug has been fixed.

  - When a room that belongs to the lobby is created with 0 specified to 
    the worldId member of SceNpMatching2CreateJoinRoomRequest, a zombie 
    room, that has no room member, may remain after a member exited the 
    room. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Clan Utility
----------------------------------------------------------------------

       the "Settings" column on the system software.
    2. Start the game application
    3. Specify 12 or more SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) (*1) and call 
       sceNpCommerceDoCheckoutStartAsync().

       (*1)Specify a list of 12 or more SKU IDs to the second argument 
           sku_ids.
           Specify the value 12 or more (the number of sku_ids) to the 
           third argument sku_num.
