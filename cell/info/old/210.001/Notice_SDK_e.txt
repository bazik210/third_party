======================================================================
The following are known bugs, limitations and cautions on 
the Reference Tool SDK package.

New updates have the release version of this package. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reference Tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- A problem has been found that when a program that outputs voice 
  from RSX(TM) is activated, and then one of the following is 
  performed, voice is not output.
  - Plug-in/out the HDMI cable
  - Switch the TV monitor power from Off to On (including the AV Amp)
  - Switch between the TV monitor channels and set the HDMI input again
    (including the AV Amp)

- The following devices are not supported now.

  - CompactFlash(R)
  - SD Memory Card
  - FOOT SW
     Note that the PA Suite 1.3.0 or later support the device.

- For specifications regarding the Reference Tool, please refer to 
  SDK_doc/jp(en)/pdf/development_basic/Reference_System-Supplement_*.pdf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
CBE Specifications
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Currently, the CBE that is equipped with each tool version can use 
  six SPUs. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Software(GUI)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 210.001)
- In the Settings -> Debug Settings -> Core Dump menu, the process 
  memory information for the virtual memory area cannot be obtained by 
  the core dump.  
  This will be supported in the future release.

(Added to Release 210.001)
- In the Check menu of the Game column, the check feature of EBOOT.BIN 
  on the disc boot game is not supported.
  This will be supported in the future release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Utilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
< Game Update Utility >
-  When the Reference Tool is booted having "Debugger mode" specified to 
   "Boot parameters" using the Administration Tool or the like, 
   the patch distribution feature of the Game Update utility cannot be 
   utilized.

< Content Search Utility >
- When file paths to the still image and animation thumbnails of content 
  are created using cellSearchPrepareFile() and the thumbnails are changed 
  from the system software, the changes will not be reflected unless 
  cellSearchPrepareFile() is executed again. 

< Message Dialog Utility >
(Added to Release 210.001)
- (B#42912)
  When a string, that is passed to the argument of cellMsgDialogOpen2(), 
  is other than the UTF-8, it ends normally where an error should have 
  been returned.
  Also the string that is passed to the argument is not displayed. 
  Instead, the following message dialog is displayed:

    "An error occurred.
      (8002B301)"

  Note that (8002B301) in the above dialog is displayed as (FFFFFFFF) in 
  SDK 200 or before.

< Remote Play Utility >
- (B#41848)
  To perform remote play with the PLAYSTATION(R)3 system software version 
  2.00, PSP(TM) system software version 3.72 or later is required.

< Access Point Utility >
(Updated in Release 210.001)
- To check the connection with PSP(TM), a ps3scan utility that is to be 
  released from PSP(TM) SDK3.80 is required.

< SubDisplay Utility>
- (B#41848)
  To use the subdisplay utility, the PSP(TM) system software version 3.72
  or later is required.

<Save Data Utility>
- There is a restriction on the string that is displayed next to 
  the thumbnail of the save data listed using cellSaveDataListDelete(). 

  When a value is specified to dirNamePrefix as shown below, it should 
  behave correctly, however, it is always displayed as "Title" in SDK 200: 

     - When "*" is specified, "Title" is displayed. 
     - When other than "*" is specified, "Subtitle" is displayed. 

  This problem will be fixed in the future SDK. 

- The option that omits the confirmation dialog displayed at the start/end
  of the cellSaveDataFixedDelete() processing does not work. This problem 
  will be fixed in the feature SDK.

- Some restrictions have been placed on each API and parameter that are 
  described in the utility header (sysutil_savedata.h). Please refer to 
  the document (SaveData-Overview/SaveData-Reference) for more details.

(Added to Release 210.001)
- When the Save Data utility API is called while another utility that 
  cannot be used together is being called, it is blocked until the utility
  that is called first ends.
  Please refer to "Conflicts between System Utilities" section in 
  the "libsysutil Overview" document fore more details on the utilities 
  that cannot be used together.

< User Infromation Utility >
- In the following APIs, the initial focus position cannot be specified.

  cellUserInfoSelectUser_SetList()
  cellUserInfoSelectUser_ListType()

<On-Screen Keyboard Utility>
- The optional dictionary feature is not supported. 

< Web Browser Utility>
- Files cannot be downloaded with the downloader. 

- The handler onMouseOver/onMouseOut of JavaScript does not work 
  properly. Use onFocus/onBlur instead.

- The performance may be slow when using ClickableMap.

< Audio Setting Utility >
- cellAudioInGetAvailableDeviceInfo() does not support devices such as 
  EyeToy USB Camera(for PlayStation 2)/PLAYSTATION(R)Eye. 
  Those devices will be supported in the future release.

- In the multi microphone mode, cellAudioInRegisterDevice() is executed with 
  an audio input device type preferred by the application specified to the 
  argument deviceType in order to resister the audio input device into 
  the system.
  When cellAudioInRegisterDevice() is called, the system software 
  automatically assign a device number regardless of whether a matching audio 
  input device is found or not. Whether the audio input device that has the 
  device number is available or not can be checked through polling using 
  cellMicIsAttached() of libmic or an event notification from libmic. 

  Since a device number is automatically assigned as described above, 
  when multiple USB devices(audio input device) of the type that the game 
  application prefers are connected to PLAYSTATION(R)3, which device being 
  connected to a USB port has which device number cannot be uniquely identified.
  In such case, a user interface should be implemented to identify it such as 
  by displaying an indicator (volume) or the like on the screen.
  Note that a mechanism that can explicitly assign a device number to 
  a specific device will be provided in the future release.

< Music Utility >
(Added in Release 210.001)
- A hung-up may occur in a game application when the playback feature 
  of the music utility and the NP friend list utility are used 
  at the same time.
  This problem occurs with the following steps.
 
  1. Call cellMusicInitialize() to initialize the playback feature.
  2. A hung-up may occur in a game application when trying to call 
     the GUI of the NP friend list utility after calling sceNpFriendlist() 
     or sceNpFriendlistCustom().

< Video Configuration Utility >
(Added in Release 210.001)
- When calling cellVideoOutSetGamma() at certain timings, 
  the mute setting of the application's video output is not disabled and 
  the screen continues to remain in the blackout state.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libnet
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added in Release 210.001)
- (B#43301)
  When the kernel work area for the network runs out, the send 
  function is blocked permanently.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Friend List Utility
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added in Release 210.001)
- A hung-up may occur in a game application when the playback feature 
  of the music utility and the NP friend list utility are used 
  at the same time.
  This problem occurs with the following steps.
 
  1. Call cellMusicInitialize() to initialize the playback feature.
  2. A hung-up may occur in a game application when trying to call 
     the GUI of the NP friend list utility after calling sceNpFriendlist() 
     or sceNpFriendlistCustom().

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Basic Utility
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added in Release 210.001)
- When calling sceNpBasicSendMessageGui() with 
  SCE_NP_BASIC_MESSAGE_MAIN_TYPE_INVITE specified to mainType in the 
  SceNpBasicMessageDetails structure, 
  the SCE_NP_BASIC_EVENT_SEND_ATTACHMENT_RESULT event occurs where
  the SCE_NP_BASIC_EVENT_SEND_INVITATION_RESULT event is expected.

  When specifying SCE_NP_BASIC_MESSAGE_MAIN_TYPE_INVITE to mainType 
  in the SceNpBasicMessageDetails structure, please handle 
  the SCE_NP_BASIC_EVENT_SEND_ATTACHMENT_RESULT event and the 
  SCE_NP_BASIC_EVENT_SEND_INVITATION_RESULT event in the same manner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NP Score Ranking Utility
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 210.001)
- Since a production server for the clan enabled ranking is not provided 
  at the moment, a master disc for a game title that supports the clan 
  enabled ranking can not be submitted.

(Added to Release 210.001)
- The development server compliant with the clan ranking will be available 
  from 2007/12/25.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BD Emulator (HDD)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When using the BD emulator on Windows, dtcfsutil.exe does not operate 
  on the msys. Please use dtcfsutil.exe on the command prompt. 
  There is no problem when using the BD emulator on Linux.
  Also note that the above restriction is applied when formatting the 
  HDD format for the BD emulator.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
dt Command
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Updated in Release 210.001)
- When boot=dbg is set using a dtcparam that is provided in SDK192 or 
  before and the boot parameter is displayed using the dtcparam command 
  in SDK200 or later, boot=unknown is displayed. Reset boot=dbg using the 
  dtcparam command in SDK200 or later.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cell OS Lv-2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- If you try to create upper limit or more memory containers with 
  sys_memory_container_create(), an ID that is the same as that of 
  the memory container that has already been allocated is returned 
  for a new memory container. When this occurs, the older memory 
  container may not be destroyed with sys_memory_container_destroy() 
  and may not be retrieved by the system even at the time of game 
  process termination. 

  [Workaround]
  Please make sure that the number of memory containers to be created 
  with a game process at the same time is less than 10. 

- The PPU program whose stack size is set to 4KB by 
  SYS_PROCESS_PARAM can not be executed because a DSI occurs before
  the main function is called. 

  [Workaround]
  Please set the stack size of a Primary PPU Thread to 8 KB or more.

(Added to Release 210.001)
- When the game process is terminated without discarding the virtual 
  memory that is generated using sys_vm_memory_map(), the system may crash.

  [Workaround]
  Explicitly discard the virtual memory area that is generated using 
  sys_vm_memory() by calling sys_vm_unmap() before the game process is 
  terminated.

(Added to Release 210.001)
- (B#44762)
  sys_memory_get_page_attribute() does not support the virtual memory 
  area.
  A return value for when a virtual memory area address is passed is not 
  defined.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libusbd
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When connecting or disconnecting a device to a USB port of the 
  machine body, other USB devices already connected may be 
  disconnected or may have an impact on its data communication.
  To avoid these problems, connect a self power hub to one of the USB 
  ports of the machine body.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libcamera
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Restrictions on the USB Video Class (UVC) Camera
  1. Does not support a UVC camera that is not compliant with the UVC 
     even though it is USB 2.0 compliant. 
  2. Does not support a camera that has no streaming function.
  3. Does not support a camera that is connected via the USB 1.1 hub.
  4. Does not support the mirror function. 
  5. Support only a single camera.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libpad for Windows
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 210.001)
- Only Windows XP is supported.
  Windows Vista will be supported in the future.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libsail
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When playing back a PAMF file, few frames(1 to 3 frames) at the end of 
  a stream cannot be obtained.

- Only the playback of a MP4 file that is created by the recording utility 
  and is placed on the built-in HDD is guaranteed. Do not embed a source code 
  that plays back other types of MP4 file in the application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfont
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The vertical rendering function does not support the Chinese character
  positioning.
  Also, it does not replace the 2-byte () and {} into the vertical 
  character codes when vertical character displacement is performed 
  internally.
  To avoid this problem, directly specify the vertical character codes 
  or use the single-byte () and {}.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libperf
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the Lv-2 system call trace is enabled with the back trace 
  on the program that is linked with libperf.a of SDK170 or before, 
  it does not work on the target system that is updated to SDK 180 and 
  later.
  (applicable to libperf/ppu sample)
  Please use libperf.a that is released after SDK 180.

(Added to Release 210.001)
- (B#43808)
  The PA Suite cannot be used to measure the performance of the sample 
  program of libperf because the measurement module on the target is 
  utilized.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 210.001)
- cellGcmSetZcull() cannot set the unbind feature for the Zcull area. 
  To set the unbind feature for the Zcull area, use cellGcmUnbindZcull().

- When the tile setting is made for the overlapping areas in RSX(TM) using 
  cellGcmSetTile(), the address conversion feature of RSX(TM) will not work 
  correctly. 

  Accordingly, new functions cellGcmSetTileInfo() and cellGcmBindTile() 
  have been added to check whether the tile areas are overlapping. 

  Please use cellGcmSetTileInfo(), cellGcmBindTile() and cellGcmUnbindTile() 
  instead of cellGcmSetTile() and cellGcmSetInvalidateTile() for future 
  development. 
  cellGcmSetTile() and cellGcmSetInvalidateTile() will be removed in the 
  future release. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
GCM Method Macro
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 210.001)
- A beta version is provided in this release.

(Added to Release 210.001)
- The range of the features in this release will not be scaled down, 
  however, the file name of gcm_method_data.h and macro names may be 
  changed.

(Added to Release 210.001)
- When you wish to use this macro in the game title, please contact our 
  technical support.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
PSGL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 210.001)
- When the 16 bit depth buffer is used, the priority will be set 
  in the order of Tiled -> Swizzled -> Linear within the library.
  When Swizzled is used, the number of pixel bits of the color buffer 
  and the depth buffer must be same(restriction of the RSX(TM) hardware). 
  As a result, when the 32 bit color and the 16bit depth buffer are used 
  together, and the Swizzeld setting is implicitly used, RSX(TM) may crash.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SPU Runtime Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<libspurs task>
- When the SPURS task calls the synchronization object and the following 
  conditions are met, an undefined behavior may be observed:

  - Conditions for entering into the WAIT state are met.
  - The context storage space is set but the LS pattern is not included 
    in the stack area.

  When the above conditions are met, CELL_SPURS_TASK_ERROR_STAT is returned 
  and the state of the synchronization object is corrupted. As a result, 
  when this synchronization object is called afterwards the behavior 
  will be undefined. 
  Also, if the caller SPURS task calls an interface that enters into 
  the WAIT state after receiving this error, the behavior will be undefined. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard C/C++ Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 210.001)
<PPU/SPU>
- When a source file is compiled under a specific condition, 
  the following message is output. 
  It is output as an error, not as a warning when the -Werror option 
  is specified.

  --------------------------------------------------------------
  In file included from C:/usr/local/cell/target/ppu/include/bits/sce_math.h:13,
                 from C:/usr/local/cell/target/ppu/include/math.h:1468,
                 from c:/usr/local/cell/target/ppu/src/PSGL/jetstream/src/Image.cpp:17 :
  C:/usr/local/cell/target/ppu/include/vec_types.h(44,1): warning: "vec_uint4" redefined
  --------------------------------------------------------------

  This problem occurs when the following conditions (a)-(c) are all met:
  (a) The windows version is used to compile the file.
  (b) The SN VSI is in use or the VSI is not in use but the -Wsystem-headers 
      option is specified. 
  (c) The header files stdlib.h and vec_types.h are included in this order.

  [Workaround] 
  To avoid this problem, the source file should be rewritten in the following 
  order so that the condition (c) will not be met: 
     #include <vec_types.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>

  This problem will be fixed in SDK220.

(Added to Release 210.001)
<SPU>
- (B#20077) 
  When the new_handler is not set in the C++ library, and failed to allocate 
  memory using "new", it enters into the infinite loop.

- If the following compile options are specified when compiling 
  a program on the PPU side, many warnings may be output. 

  -Wall -Wundef -Wundef -Wsystem-headers -Wcast-qual

- When compiling an SPU program that included math.h, an error occurs 
  if -fsingle-precision-constant is specified as the compile option. 

- When including the system header, include it outside extern "C" or 
  extern "C++". 

  For example, an error may occur if a program such as below is compiled:

    extern "C" {
      ...

      #include <yyyy> // NG : Including within extern "C". 

      ...
    }

  The error can be avoided by rewriting the program as shown below: 

    #include <yyyy>
    extern "C" {

      ... 

    }

<PPU>
- When starting up a program in which <iostream> is included, the constructor 
  of iostream will call the new operator. When you want to avoid calling 
  "new" before executing the main function, do not use iostream.

<PPU>
- There are following limitations on the usage of atexit function.

  * If a function in a PRX module is registered using atexit function,
    and if main function finishes or exit function is invoked after the 
    PRX module is stopped, a DSI (data storage interrupt) will occur.

  * If atexit function is used in a C++ global constructor, the behavior 
    is different from the C++ standard.  All the registered functions are 
    invoked prior to all the global destructors.

<PPU>
- If you use class ios_base or any of its derived classes (fstream,
  iostream, stringstream, strstream, etc.) in PRX, create their 
  instances in ELF, and pass the pointers to them to PRX.  If they are 
  created in PRX, a DSI (data storage interrupt) may occur in function 
  _Fac_tidy() at the termination of the PPU program.

<SPU>
- If very large amount of stack or heap area is used, heap area may be 
  destroyed.  SPU ABI allows accessing memory at negative offsets from 
  stack pointer up to -2000 as well as positive offsets, but using 
  negative offsets is not guaranteed in some cases due to a bug.
  Negative offsets from stack pointer are used in spu_printf(), leaf 
  functions, etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sample Program(cell/samples)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 210.001)
- When the program is to be built on Visual Studio 2005 because the 
  solution/project files of Visual Studio 2003 taht comes with the sample 
  have been converted into Visual Studio 2005 version, it is required to 
  set as follows:

  [Maximum number of parallel project builds] should be set with 1 from 
  [Tools] -> [Options] -> [Projects and Solutions] -> [Build and Run].
  When this maximum number is set with 2 or more, it may fail to build a 
  project.

(Added to Release 210.001)
- When the solution file that contains Framework.vcproj is converted 
  from VisualStudio2003 version into VisualStudio2005 version, a build 
  structure, which does not exist in the solution file of VisualStudio2003 
  version, is wrongly added.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libftp
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Transfer speeds start to slow significantly once more than two
  simultaneous transfer streams are employed.

- It may fail to make a connection with Internet Explorer 6.0.

- Passive transfer mode (PASV) is currently not supported.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libscream
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 210.001)
- The scream library is normally updated and synchronised with MultiStream 
  using the cellScreamMSSync() function. This function is normally called 
  separately from update functions such as cellScreamSetMasterVolume().
  A bug has been detected where calling these functions from separate 
  threads can sometimes lead to corruption of internal data and a subsequent 
  crash.

  Workaround
  The bug can be avoided by wrapping calls to cellScreamMSSync() and parameter 
  update functions (including cellScreamSetMasterVolume()) with mutexes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmstream
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 210.001)
- The *.pic file can be found under cell/samples/sdk/sound/multistream/
  dspeffectsm, however, use the PPU object file(*.ppu.o), that is located 
  under cell/target/spu/lib/pic/multistream, in the game application. 

(Added to Release 210.001)
- cellMSSystemConfigureSysUtil() is to be deleted in the future. 
  Please migrate to cellMSSystemConfigureSysUtilEx(), that has been added 
  to SDK200.002, in the game application. 

- In Time Domain only mode, ADPCM data at low sample rates (< 24khz) 
  can cause noise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
cgc
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added to Release 210.001)
- When the vertex shader is compiled using the -cgb option at runtime
  (when compile_program_from_string() is used), 0 is returned to 
  attributeOutputMask and userClipMask. 
  Note that this problem occurs only with the libraries for PLAYSTATION(R)3, 
  not with the libraries for Windows/Linux.
