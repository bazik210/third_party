======================================================================
The following are known bugs and limitations on PLAYSTATION(R)3 Programmer
Tool Toolchain package.

New updates have the release version of this package.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SN Systems Linker
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<PPU>
(B#41094)
(Added to Release 200.002)
- The SN Systems linker for Linux does not run under Linux kernel 2.6.8
  or earlier versions. The following error occurs when linking a program.

    FATAL: kernel too old
    collect2: ld terminated with signal 11 [Segmentation fault]

  If you need to fix this urgently, please contact the Private Support
  as soon as possible.

(B#41250)
(Added to Release 200.002)
- The SN Systems linker and the CIL cannot be used together.
  In SDK 200, the PPU uses the SN Systems linker by default, therefore, 
  the CIL sample also cannot be used. 
  When you wish to use the CIL for the PPU program, specify 
  "--app-final-ld-flags -mno-sn-ld" option to the ppu-lv2-cil command. 

(B#41339)
(Added to Release 200.002)
- When using the SN Systems linker, the -muse-save-restore-funcs option 
  cannot be specified.

(B#42756)
(Added to Release 200.002)
- If your program relies on C++ exception handling it is necessary to
  use the GNU linker in place of the SN Systems linker by using the
  -mno-sn-ld switch.

  If you need to fix this urgently, please contact the Private Support.

(B#41363)
(Added to Release 200.002)
- The dead code and data stripping implementation in the SN Systems linker
  requires that all object files and libraries are built with the SDK200 or
  later toolchains.  Any object files or libraries built with earlier
  versions will not be dead stripped.

  If you rely on libraries built with earlier versions of the toolchain
  (such as middleware), please contact developer support for a tool which
  can be used to update these to enable dead stripping.

(B#41363)
(Added to Release 200.002)
- The linker script supplied with SDK200 contains an instruction that
  disables dead stripping by the SN Systems linker.
  If you need to fix this urgently, please contact the Private Support.

GCC
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<PPU/SPU>
(B#41261)
(Added to Release 200.002)
- When a response file is used on Linux, it ends in error when being 
  linked.

(B#39973)
(Added to Release 200.002)
- Although the -save-temps-o option is specified when compiling a C++
  program, the process result(extension: .ii) is not saved.

(B#20822)
(Added to Release 200.002)
- DWARF information may not be correctly created.

(B#23547)
(Added to Release 200.002)
- Among the C++ class definitions, debug information cannot be correctly
  created for those onto which typedef has been performed.

(B#24159)
(Added to Release 200.002)
- Among the C++ anonymous namespaces, debug information cannot be correctly
  created for the enum type.

- When the header file that uses a C++ anonymous namespace is precompiled
  and multiple object files that use the header file are linked,
  the following error is displayed: 

    multiple definition of `(anonymous namespace)::x'

- When a header file is pre-compiled with -MD or -MMD options, a 
  dependency file to be generated incorrectly contains the dependency
  infomation of the .o file. 
  In such a case, explicitly specify the output file at the pre-compiling
  process as shown below:

   Example: ppu-lv2-gcc -MMD test.h -o test.h.gch

- If vmx2spu.h or spu2vmx.h is used from C programs, errors are
  displayed. To avoid the problem, please use it from C++ programs.

- When a program with a comment, as in the example below, is compiled, 
  a warning message is output to the console.

  Example)
  //int blahblah;\
  //int behbeh;

<PPU>

(B#20191)
(Added to Release 200.002)
- Exclusive control is not exerted in the initialization of the static
  variable declared within the function.

- If compiled with the option -Wall or -Wformat, a warning is issued 
  when the conversion specification %Er is used with the function 
  strftime of time.h. 
  The conversion specification %Er is a nonstandard extension feature. 
  Therefore, this warning can be ignored. 

- When 2 programs such as the codes in the example below are compiled, 
  a different code is generated respectively.

  Example)
  --- program1 -----
   A foo;
   B bar;
   foo = *reinterpret_cast<A *>(&bar);
  --- program2 ----
   A foo;
   B bar;
   *reinterpret_cast<B *>(&foo) = bar;

- When a program such as the code in the example below is compiled with
  the optimization option set to -02 or more, it is less optimized 
  than when gcc3.4 is used.

  Example)
  typedef union
  {
    float f[4];
    vector float vf;
  }
  Union128;
  vector float
  make_vector_from_float (float x, float y, float z, float w)
  {
    Union128 u;

    u.f[0] = x;
    u.f[1] = y;
    u.f[2] = z;
    u.f[3] = w;
    return u.vf;
  }

- When the following cast is performed, the program does not work 
  correctly.

  dist += a->b[0] * (*reinterpret_cast< const vec_t * >
  ( reinterpret_cast< const byte * >(arg)+ c->d[0] ));

- Even though a program such as the code in the example below is compiled
  with optimization enabled, unnecessary instructions may be output:

  Example)
  -- Program ---
     while(size>0){
         *(dst++) = *(src++);
         size--;
     }
  -- Assembly code ---
     ld 11,0(4)
     addi 0,3,8
     addi 9,4,8
     std 11,0(3)
     rldicl 3,0,0,32 <- Unnecessary
     rldicl 4,9,0,32 <- Unnecessary
     bdnz .L4
     blr"

- When a program such as the code in the example below, which uses the 
  __may_alias__ attribute within the template is compiled, an internal 
  compiler error occurs.

  Example)
  template <typename T>
  void f() 
  { 
    typedef T __attribute__((__may_alias__)) A;
  }


- Although an optimization process is performed when compiling a program,
  the clrldi instruction which is not required may be output.

- When a program that contains the VMX instruction is compiled, the 
  optimization is not performed efficiently. 
  Accordingly, an unnecessary instruction may be left within the 
  internal processing of the loop statement. When this problem occurs,
  describe the processing of the loop statement using the asm statement.

- In PPU program, even when "align" is specified to the variable 
  assigned to the TLS area, the alignment process may not be performed.
  This behavior is defined by the specifications of Cell OS Lv-2.
  Please do not specify "align".

- When calling other functions from the PPU program in the assembly 
  language, the following should be noted to set the correct value 
  for TOC pointer(r2).

  (1) Always insert nop instruction after bl instruction. By doing so,
      when the function to be called uses a different TOC pointer, 
      the linker will generate a linkage code to replace nop with an 
      appropriate instruction.

      Example:
                 bl              .foo
                 nop

  (2) Always include ".toc" section (can be empty) in the assembler
      source file. This is a current restriction of the linker.
     
      Example: Put the following at the beginning of the file
           .section        ".toc","aw"
           .section        ".text"

<SPU>
- Depending on the order by which the math.h header file and 
  the vector header file of C++ STL are included, a syntax error occurs. 
  When including both, please be sure to include math.h first. 

  Example)
  /* OK */
  #include <math.h>
  #include <vector>

  /* NG */
  #include <vector>
  #include <math.h>

- If a position independent code (PIC) is generated using the -fpic option,
  C++ virtual functions cannot be used.

- According to chapter 7 of "Cell OS Lv-2 C/C++ Language Extensions 
  for SPU", when the type of an operand within an expression is double 
  and the operand is a denormal number, it should be considered as 0.0 
  or -0.0. However, with the current compiler, the optimization result 
  may not adhere to this. 

- If the -funroll-loops option and the -frerun-cse-before-sched option 
  are specified at the same time, an incorrect code is generated. 
  Please do not specify the -frerun-cse-before-sched option. 

- If an object or elf that includes the brsl instruction is disassembled 
  with spu-lv2-objdump, not the value to be added to $pc, but the address
  that is obtained by adding s18 and $pc is displayed with the "brsl rt,
  s18" instruction. 

- With spu-lv2-gcc and spu-lv2-g++, when the optimization option is 
  -O1 or more and the arguments of the spu_roundf and si_frds 
  intrinsic functions can be calculated at the time of compilation, 
  the specified rounding mode (by default, round to nearest) is not 
  used and the calculation is done by rounding down. 

  Example)
    vec_float4 f(void) {
      return spu_roundtf(((vec_double2){
        0,12345678.9
      }));
    }
