======================================================================
The following are known bugs, limitations and cautions on 
the Reference Tool SDK package.

New updates have the release version of this package. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reference Tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- A problem has been found that when a program that outputs voice 
  from RSX(TM) is activated, and then one of the following is 
  performed, voice is not output.
  - Plug-in/out the HDMI cable
  - Switch the TV monitor power from Off to On (including the AV Amp)
  - Switch between the TV monitor channels and set the HDMI input again
    (including the AV Amp)

- The following devices are not supported now.

  - CompactFlash(R)
  - SD Memory Card
  - FOOT SW

  The wireless feature (Bluetooth(R)/Wireless LAN) can only be used 
  on Reference Tools DEH-R1040 and later, which have the necessary 
  authorization tools.
  The antenna for the wireless feature is bundled with DEH-1040 and 
  later Reference Tools. Do not attempt to connect DEH-R1030 and 
  earlier Reference Tools.

- For specifications regarding the Reference Tool, please refer to 
  info/Reference_System-Supplement_*.pdf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
CBE Specifications
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Currently, the CBE that is equipped with each tool version can use 
  six SPUs. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Utilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
< Game Update Utility >
(Added in Release 200.002)
-  When the Reference Tool is booted having "Debugger mode" specified to 
   "Boot parameters" using the Administration Tool  or the like, 
   the patch distribution feature of the Game Update utility cannot be 
   utilized.

< Content Search Utility >
- When file paths to the still image and animation thumbnails of content 
  are created using cellSearchPrepareFile() and the thumbnails are changed 
  from the system software, the changes will not be reflected unless 
  cellSearchPrepareFile() is executed again. 

<Save Data Utility>
- There is a restriction on the string that is displayed next to 
  the thumbnail of the save data listed using cellSaveDataListDelete(). 

  When a value is specified to dirNamePrefix as shown below, it should 
  behave correctly, however, it is always displayed as "Title" in SDK 200: 

     - When "*" is specified, "Title" is displayed. 
     - When other than "*" is specified, "Subtitle" is displayed. 

  This problem will be fixed in the future SDK. 

(Added in Release 200.002)
- The option that omits the confirmation dialog displayed at the start/end
  of the cellSaveDataFixedDelete() processing does not work. This problem 
  will be fixed in the feature SDK.

(Added in Release 200.002)
- Some restrictions have been placed on each API and parameter that are 
  described in the utility header (sysutil_savedata.h). Please refer to 
  the document (SaveData-Overview/SaveData-Reference) for more details.

< Remote Play Utility >
(Added in Release 200.002)
- (B#39730)
  The Reference Tool cannot recognize a disc after performing remote start.

(Added in Release 200.002)
- (B#41848)
  To perform remote play with the PLAYSTATION(R)3 system software version 
  2.00, PSP(TM) system software version 3.72 or later is required.

< SubDisplay Utility>
(Added in Release 200.002)
- (B#41848)
  To use the subdisplay utility, the PSP(TM) system software version 3.72
  or later is required.

< Access Point Utility >
(Added in Release 200.002)
- To check the connection with PSP(TM), a ps3scan utility that is to be 
  released from PSP(TM) SDK is required.

< User Infromation Utility >
(Added in Release 200.002)
- In the following APIs, the initial focus position cannot be specified.

  cellUserInfoSelectUser_SetList()
  cellUserInfoSelectUser_ListType()

<On-Screen Keyboard Utility>
- The optional dictionary feature is not supported. 

< Audio Setting Utility >
(Added in Release 200.002)
- In the multi microphone mode, cellAudioInRegisterDevice() is executed with 
  an audio input device type preferred by the application specified to the 
  argument deviceType in order to resister the audio input device into 
  the system.
  When cellAudioInRegisterDevice() is called, the system software 
  automatically assign a device number regardless of whether a matching audio 
  input device is found or not. Whether the audio input device that has the 
  device number is available or not can be checked through polling using 
  cellMicIsAttached() of limbic or an event notification from libmic. 

  Since a device number is automatically assigned as described above, 
  when multiple USB devices(audio input device) of the type that the game 
  application prefers are connected to PLAYSTATION(R)3, which device being 
  connected to a USB port has which device number cannot be uniquely identified.
  In such case, a user interface should be implemented to identify it such as 
  by displaying an indicator (volume) or the like on the screen.
  Note that a mechanism that can explicitly assign a device number to 
  a specific device will be provided in the future release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libperf
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When the Lv-2 system call trace is enabled with the back trace 
  on the program that is linked with libperf.a of SDK170 or before, 
  it does not work on the target system that is updated to SDK 180 and later.
  (applicable to libperf/ppu sample)
  Please use libperf.a that is released after SDK 180.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BD Emulator (HDD)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When using the BD emulator on Windows, dtcfsutil.exe does not operate 
  on the msys. Please use dtcfsutil.exe on the command prompt. 
  There is no problem when using the BD emulator on Linux.
  Also note that the above restriction is applied when formatting the 
  HDD format for the BD emulator.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfont
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The vertical rendering function does not support the Chinese character
  positioning.
  Also, it does not replace the 2-byte () and {} into the vertical 
  character codes when vertical character displacement is performed 
  internally.
  To avoid this problem, directly specify the vertical character codes 
  or use the single-byte () and {}.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libusbd
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When connecting or disconnecting a device to a USB port of the 
  machine body, other USB devices already connected may be 
  disconnected or may have an impact on its data communication.
  To avoid these problems, connect a self power hub to one of the USB 
  ports of the machine body.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cell OS Lv-2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- If you try to create upper limit or more memory containers with 
  sys_memory_container_create(), an ID that is the same as that of 
  the memory container that has already been allocated is returned 
  for a new memory container. When this occurs, the older memory 
  container may not be destroyed with sys_memory_container_destroy() 
  and may not be retrieved by the system even at the time of game 
  process termination. 

  [Workaround]
  Please make sure that the number of memory containers to be created 
  with a game process at the same time is less than 10. 

- The PPU program whose stack size is set to 4KB by 
  SYS_PROCESS_PARAM can not be executed because a DSI occurs before
  the main function is called. 

  [Workaround]
  Please set the stack size of a Primary PPU Thread to 8 KB or more.

(Added in Release 200.002)
- When a target address of a page fault notification is passed to the 
  system call to which a process address should have been passed as an 
  argument and a page fault occurs, the kernel may be corrupted if the 
  process is ended without recovering the thread. 

  [Workaround]
  Map the target address page, recover the PPU thread using 
  sys_ppu_thread_recover_page_fault(), and then end the process.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added in Release 200.002)
- When the SNC compiler is in use and gcm_implementaion_sub.h is 
  included, a compiler error 1045-D occurs.
  The compiler error can be avoided by applying either of the followings:

  1. Add the compile option --diag_suppress=1045
  2. Add the following to the beginning of gcm_implementaion_sub.h
         #ifdef __SNC__
           #pragma diag_suppress=1045
         #endif

(Added in Release 200.002)
- When outputting a graphics error, an offset value of the tiled area on 
  the main memory cannot be displayed correctly.

(Added in Release 200.002)
- When cellGcmMapMainMemory() returns CELL_GCM_ERROR_NO_IO_PAGE_TABLE, 
  and if cellGcmSortRemapEaIoAddress() is called having the lightweight mutex 
  unlocked, an error occurs due to the lightweight mutex lock. 
  This bug will be fixed in SDK210.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm_tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The windows version of libgcm_tool is available only with VisualStudio2005. 
  Also note that the sample project file is created using VisualStudio2005.
  Both the library and the sample are not compliant with VisualStudio2003.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard C/C++ Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added in Release 200.002)
- (B#41083) PPU
  From SDK200 onwards, although fflush(NULL) is successfully completed, 
  0 is not returned.
  To avoid this problem, specify each stream to the argument and call 
  fflush.

(Added in Release 200.002)
- (B#42013) PPU
  memcpy16() that has been added to SDK200 does not work correctly 
  when the copy size is less than 128 bytes.

- If the following compile options are specified when compiling 
  a program on the PPU side, many warnings may be output. 

  -Wall -Wundef -Wundef -Wsystem-headers -Wcast-qual

- When compiling an SPU program that included math.h, an error occurs 
  if -fsingle-precision-constant is specified as the compile option. 

- When including the system header, include it outside extern "C" or 
  extern "C++". 

  For example, an error may occur if a program such as below is compiled:

    extern "C" {
      ...

      #include <yyyy> // NG : Including within extern "C". 

      ...
    }

  The error can be avoided by rewriting the program as shown below: 

    #include <yyyy>
    extern "C" {

      ... 

    }

<PPU>
- When starting up a program in which <iostream> is included, the constructor 
  of iostream will call the new operator. When you want to avoid calling 
  "new" before executing the main function, do not use iostream.

<PPU>
- There are following limitations on the usage of atexit function.

  * If a function in a PRX module is registered using atexit function,
    and if main function finishes or exit function is invoked after the 
    PRX module is stopped, a DSI (data storage interrupt) will occur.

  * If atexit function is used in a C++ global constructor, the behavior 
    is different from the C++ standard.  All the registered functions are 
    invoked prior to all the global destructors.

<PPU>
- If you use class ios_base or any of its derived classes (fstream,
  iostream, stringstream, strstream, etc.) in PRX, create their 
  instances in ELF, and pass the pointers to them to PRX.  If they are 
  created in PRX, a DSI (data storage interrupt) may occur in function 
  _Fac_tidy() at the termination of the PPU program.

<SPU>
- If very large amount of stack or heap area is used, heap area may be 
  destroyed.  SPU ABI allows accessing memory at negative offsets from 
  stack pointer up to -2000 as well as positive offsets, but using 
  negative offsets is not guaranteed in some cases due to a bug.
  Negative offsets from stack pointer are used in spu_printf(), leaf 
  functions, etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libsail
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added in Release 200.002)
- When playing back a PAMF file, few frames(1 to 3 frames) at the end of 
  a stream cannot be obtained.

- Only the playback of a MP4 file that is created by the recording utility 
  and is placed on the built-in HDD is guaranteed. Do not embed a source code 
  that plays back other types of MP4 file in the application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SPU Runtime Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<libspurs task>
- When the SPURS task calls the synchronization object and the following 
  conditions are met, an undefined behavior may be observed:

  - Conditions for entering into the WAIT state are met.
  - The context storage space is set but the LS pattern is not included 
    in the stack area.

  When the above conditions are met, CELL_SPURS_TASK_ERROR_STAT is returned 
  and the state of the synchronization object is corrupted. As a result, 
  when this synchronization object is called afterwards the behavior 
  will be undefined. 
  Also, if the caller SPURS task calls an interface that enters into 
  the WAIT state after receiving this error, the behavior will be undefined. 

(Added in Release 200.002)
- (B#42842)
  When cellSpursEventFlagWait() is called from the PPU thread, an infinite 
  loop may occur within the function.
  This problem may occur when the following conditions are all met at the time 
  of (3).

  (1) CELL_SPURS_EVENT_FLAG_ANY2ANY is specified to the fourth argument 
      "direction" of cellSpursEventFlagInitialize() and a SPURS event flag is 
      initialized.

  (2) cellSpursEventFlagWait() is called for the SPURS event flag described 
      in (1) so the SPURS task is in a wait state.

  (3) cellSpursEventFlagWait() is called for the SPURS event flag described 
      in (1) from the PPU thread, but the release condition from the wait 
      state is not met.

<libspurs Core>
(Added in Release 200.002)
- (B#43285)
  spu_printf_initialize(), a function newly added to SDK200, can not be used 
  with SPURS because if spu_printf_attach_group() or spu_printf_attach_thread()
  is executed for SPURS, the processing will fail. Please use spu_printf() in 
  SPURS as before. 
  This problem will be fixed in SDK 210. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
dt Command
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added in Release 200.002)
- When boot=dbg is set using a dtcparam that is provided in SDK192 or 
  before and the boot parameter is displayed using the dtcparam command 
  in SDK 200, boot=unknown is displayed. Reset boot=dbg using the 
  dtcparam command in SDK 200.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libcamera
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Restrictions on the USB Video Class (UVC) Camera
  1. Does not support a UVC camera that is not compliant with the UVC 
     even though it is USB 2.0 compliant. 
  2. Does not support a camera that has no streaming function.
  3. Does not support a camera that is connected via the USB 1.1 hub.
  4. Does not support the mirror function. 
  5. Support only a single camera.
  6. EyeToy USB Camera(for PlayStation 2) is given a higher priority 
     when it is connected. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libmic
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Added in Release 200.002)
- Multiple Bluetooth(R) microphones/headsets are not supported due to
  Bluetooth(R) device registration limitation.   

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libftp
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Transfer speeds start to slow significantly once more than two
  simultaneous transfer streams are employed.

- It may fail to make a connection with Internet Explorer 6.0.

- Passive transfer mode (PASV) is currently not supported.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
MultiStream
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In Time Domain only mode, ADPCM data at low sample rates (< 24khz) 
  can cause noise.

(Added in Release 200.002)
- I3DL2 reverb DSP has a problem with the initalization of the I3DL2 reverb 
  memory.
  Please call memset with a value of 0 on the 16-byte aligned memory allocated 
  before being passed to the cellMSFXI3DL2Init() function.
