======================================================================
The following are known bugs, limitations and cautions on 
the Reference Tool SDK package.

New updates have the release version of this package. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reference Tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- A problem has been found that when a program that outputs voice 
  from RSX(TM) is activated, and then one of the following is 
  performed, voice is not output.
  - Plug-in/out the HDMI cable
  - Switch the TV monitor power from Off to On (including the AV Amp)
  - Switch between the TV monitor channels and set the HDMI input again
    (including the AV Amp)

- The following devices are not supported now.

  - CompactFlash(R)
  - SD Memory Card
  - FOOT SW

  The wireless feature (Bluetooth(R)/Wireless LAN) can only be used 
  on Reference Tools DEH-R1040 and later, which have the necessary 
  authorization tools.
  The antenna for the wireless feature is bundled with DEH-1040 and 
  later Reference Tools. Do not attempt to connect DEH-R1030 and 
  earlier Reference Tools.

- For specifications regarding the Reference Tool, please refer to 
  info/PS3-FAQ_*.pdf.

- Currently, the status does not change even if the DRIVE SELECT 
  switch of the front panel is pressed. 

  However, by resetting (or rebooting) the Reference Tool after 
  switching between "BD emulator (HDD)" and "BD drive" in 
  "Blu-ray Disc access" of "Boot parameters" on the Administration 
  Tool, it is possible to switch the LED to be illuminated on 
  the front panel ("HDD drive LED" or "Blu-ray Disc drive LED"). 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
CBE Specifications
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Currently, the CBE that is equipped with each tool version can use 
  six SPUs. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Software
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Since a change has been made so that a process termination wait occurs 
  when the power off processing is performed in the case of when booted 
  from the debugger, with some of the samples that do not support 
  the termination processing of game applications, a timeout occurs 
  and the system is forcibly terminated with a warning sound when 
  the power off processing is performed in the case of when booted from 
  the debugger. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
System Utilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Web Browser Utility>
- Files cannot be downloaded with the downloader. 

- When an image is decoded using the heap area for contents close to 
  the upper limit, it may hang up.

- The handler onMouseOver/onMouseOut of JavaScript does not work 
  properly. Use onFocus/onBlur instead.

- The performance may be slow when using ClickableMap.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BD Emulator (HDD)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- When using the BD emulator on Windows, dtcfsutil.exe does not operate 
  on the msys. Please use dtcfsutil.exe on the command prompt. 
  There is no problem when using the BD emulator on Linux.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
File System
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<cellftp>
- The -u option of the put command does not work correctly.

- Although the option -u of the copy command or the copydir command 
  is specified, it does not work correctly if the copy destination is HOSTFS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cell OS Lv-2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- If you try to create upper limit or more memory containers with 
  sys_memory_container_create(), an ID that is the same as that of 
  the memory container that has already been allocated is returned 
  for a new memory container. When this occurs, the older memory 
  container may not be destroyed with sys_memory_container_destroy() 
  and may not be retrieved by the system even at the time of game 
  process termination. 

  [Workaround]
  Please make sure that the number of memory containers to be created 
  with a game process at the same time is less than 10. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
CODEC
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<libvdec>
- It is assumed that the outputs of the samples are output to 
  a PC monitor with a resolution of SXGA or more or to an HDMI monitor 
  that supports 1280x720/60p input.
  Therefore, if the monitor setting is not performed appropriately 
  in advance with the setmonitor utility, the samples will display 
  an warning message. 

<libdmux>
- When calling cellDmuxDisableEs(), please make sure that the video/audio 
  decoder is not decoding the applicable ES (Elementary Stream) before 
  calling. 
  Specifically, it is recommended to call cellDmuxDisableEs() after 
  CELL_VDEC_MSG_TYPE_AUDONE/CELL_ADEC_MSG_TYPE_AUDONE for the AU input 
  to the video/audio decoder is received or after 
  cellVdecClose()/cellAdecClose() is called. 

- The message CELL_DMUX_MSG_TYPE_DEMUX_DONE may not be sent when 
  demuxer is closed in the following sequence:
  1. demuxer is running with the presence of valid ESs
  2. Disable all the valid ES Handles by cellDmuxDisableEs()
  3. Wait for CELL_DMUX_MSG_TYPE_DEMUX_DONE message(stop the 
     self-running state)
  4. Close demuxer by calling cellDmuxClose()
  * Note that this problem also occurs in a sequence where 
    cellDmuxResetStream() is called before and after step 2.
  To avoid this problem, do not wait for CELL_DMUX_MSG_TYPE_DEMUX_DONE 
  message(stop the self-running state) in step 3.

<libvpost>
- It is assumed that the outputs of the samples are output to 
  a PC monitor with a resolution of SXGA or more or to an HDMI monitor 
  that supports 1280x720/60p input. Therefore, if the monitor setting 
  is not performed appropriately in advance with the setmonitor utility, 
  the samples will display an error message and will be aborted. 

<libjpgdec>
- It is assumed that the outputs of the samples are output to 
  a PC monitor with a resolution of SXGA or more or to an HDMI monitor 
  that supports 1280x720/60p input. Therefore, if the monitor setting 
  is not performed appropriately in advance with the setmonitor utility, 
  the samples will display an error message and will be aborted. 

<libpngdec>
- It is assumed that the outputs of the samples are output to 
  a PC monitor with a resolution of SXGA or more or to an HDMI monitor 
  that supports 1280x720/60p input. Therefore, if the monitor setting 
  is not performed appropriately in advance with the setmonitor utility, 
  the samples will display an error message and will be aborted. 

- Even if the information of sCAL chunk exists in the stream, 
  the bit supported by dataOutInfo->chunkInformation is not validated. 

<libadec>
- SPURS stops with an exceptional event when usign ATRAC3plus decoder.

  Details:
  SPURS may stop with an exceptional event when ATRAC3plus decoder is in use.
  This problem may occur when either one of the following conditions is met:

  - libsail is used to play ATRAC3plus data that is created by Stream Composer.
  - libadec is used to decode the same data as above directly.

  Note that this problem does not occur when you use libatrac3plus to play 
  data created by at3tool.

  Workaround
  Do not include ATRAC3plus data in PAMF file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libsail
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In CellSailPlayerInitialize(), video is not started in the PAL 
  output environment when CELL_SAIL_PLAYER_PRESET_AV_SYNC is set.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libfont
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- With the following functions, hangul characters cannot be rendered 
  to the correct base line position. 
  When using hangul characters, please do not use them. 

  Functions for getting outline glyph
  cellFontGenerateCharGlyph()
  cellFontGenerateCharGlyphVertical()

  Functions for rendering from outline glyph
  cellFontGlyphRenderImage()
  cellFontGlyphRenderImageHorizontal()
  cellFontGlyphRenderImageVertical()

  Functions for vertical rendering
  cellFontRenderCharGlyphImageVertical()

- The initial size of the rendering work buffer is allocated as 
  the buffer initial size that is specified with the argument 
  CellFontRendererConfig of cellFontCreateRenderer(), but when 
  a rendering function if called, it is changed to the buffer size 
  that becomes necessary at that time. Therefore, it is meaningless 
  to specify the initial size. 
  (With CellFontRendererConfig_setAllocateBuffer(&config,initSize,maxSize),
  it is not possible to control the memory allocation 
  operation even when initSize == maxSize.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard C/C++ Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- If the following compile options are specified when compiling 
  a program on the PPU side, many warnings may be output. 

  -Wall -Wundef -Wundef -Wsystem-headers -Wcast-qual

- When compiling an SPU program that included math.h, an error occurs 
  if -fsingle-precision-constant is specified as the compile option. 

- When including the system header, include it outside extern "C" or 
  extern "C++". 

  For example, an error may occur if a program such as below is compiled:

    extern "C" {
      ...

      #include <yyyy> // NG : Including within extern "C". 

      ...
    }

  The error can be avoided by rewriting the program as shown below: 

    #include <yyyy>
    extern "C" {

      ... 

    }

<PPU>
- There are following limitations on the usage of atexit function.

  * If a function in a PRX module is registered using atexit function,
    and if main function finishes or exit function is invoked after the 
    PRX module is stopped, a DSI (data storage interrupt) will occur.

  * If atexit function is used in a C++ global constructor, the behavior 
    is different from the C++ standard.  All the registered functions are 
    invoked prior to all the global destructors.

<PPU>
- If you use class ios_base or any of its derived classes (fstream,
  iostream, stringstream, strstream, etc.) in PRX, create their 
  instances in ELF, and pass the pointers to them to PRX.  If they are 
  created in PRX, a DSI (data storage interrupt) may occur in function 
  _Fac_tidy() at the termination of the PPU program.

<SPU>
- If rounding mode is set by function fesetround in fenv.h, there is a 
  bug that the setting is effective in only the operations on slice 1 of 
  vector double type.  Round to nearest even mode (default) is used for 
  the operations on double type and on slice 0 of vector double type.

  The problem can be worked around by using the following code instead 
  of fesetround.  Replace FE_TOWARDZERO with the mode to be set.
  vector unsigned int r=spu_mffpscr();
  r=spu_sel(r,spu_splats(((unsigned int)FE_TOWARDZERO*5)<<8),
            ((vector unsigned int){0x0000FF00,0,0,0}));
  spu_mtfpscr(r);
  See also technical notes "Rounding control of SPU 
  double-precision floating-point operations".

<PPU/SPU>
- If programs that include header stdlib.h are compiled with any of the 
  following options, errors will be reported at link-time (PPU side) or 
  compile-time (SPU side, C++).
  -D_NO_INLINE_DEFINITIONS
  -std=c89
  -std=gnu89
  -std=c++98

<SPU>
- If very large amount of stack or heap area is used, heap area may be 
  destroyed.  SPU ABI allows accessing memory at negative offsets from 
  stack pointer up to -2000 as well as positive offsets, but using 
  negative offsets is not guaranteed in some cases due to a bug.
  Negative offsets from stack pointer are used in spu_printf(), leaf 
  functions, etc.

<PPU/SPU>
- The following macro names will be changed because they generally 
  overlap with the names that are defined when creating an application.

  CPOLY(x)        ppu/include/bits/sincos_c.h
  POW2(x)         ppu/include/bits/sincos_c.h
  SPOLY(x)        ppu/include/bits/sincos_c.h
  M_PI            ppu/include/bits/sincos_c.h, spu/include/bits/sincos_c.h
  LOWER_MASK      ppu/include/bits/mt19937_impl.h, spu/include/bits/mt19937.h
  MATRIX_A        ppu/include/bits/mt19937_impl.h, spu/include/bits/mt19937.h
  UPPER_MASK      ppu/include/bits/mt19937_impl.h, spu/include/bits/mt19937.h
  MAX_RESULT      ppu/include/bits/f_exp2f.h, spu/include/bits/f_exp2f.h
  M_LN2           ppu/include/bits/f_exp2f.h, spu/include/bits/f_exp2f.h
  M_LOG2E         ppu/include/bits/f_expf.h, spu/include/bits/f_expf.h
  M_TT800         ppu/include/bits/tt800_globals.h, 
                  spu/include/bits/tt800_globals.h
  N_TT800         ppu/include/bits/tt800_globals.h, 
                  spu/include/bits/tt800_globals.h
  N_TT800_QWORDS  ppu/include/bits/tt800_globals.h, 
                  spu/include/bits/tt800_globals.h
  VERSION_1       spu/include/bits/strncmp.h
  VERSION_2       spu/include/bits/strncmp.h
  VERSION_3       spu/include/bits/strncmp.h
  VERSION_4       spu/include/bits/strncmp.h

<PPU>
- When a program is compiled with -Wshadow option, a warning message may be 
  output because the standard header file has a wrong description.

<PPU>
- powf(0.1f, 46.0f) returns "INFINITY"; it should return "0.0f" instead.
  powf(0.001f, -15.0f) returns "0.0f"; it should return "INFINITY" instead.
  powf(-INFINITY, y) returns "0.0f" in condition that the argument y is 
  a negative odd integer; it should return "-0.0f" instead.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The following constant macros are to be deleted in the future version 
  since they are not supported by RSX(TM).
  CELL_GCM_BLEND_COLOR = (0x8005),
  CELL_GCM_BLEND_EQUATION = (0x8009),

----------------------------------------------------------------------
libgcm/PSGL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Flip completion notice is returned before completion.
  For details, see the Technical Note 200609-23.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SPU Runtime Library
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<libdaisy>
- When the template arguments tOutPort, tInPort and tMode are specified 
  at the time of instance creation using the cell::Daisy::Glue template 
  class as shown below, QUEUE_IS_BUSY may be retuned repeatedly instead 
  of TERMINATED(correct return value) even though all the data flow 
  processes are completed when the function step() is called for the instance.

  tOutPort
  Instance with tMode = COPY(Default value) specified when this instance 
  is created using the cell::Daisy::Pipe::OutPort template class or 
  the cell::Daisy::GatherPipe::OutPort template class.
  
  tInPort
  Instance with tMode = REFERENCE specified when this instance is created 
  using the cell::Daisy::Pipe::InPort template class or 
  the cell::Daisy::ScatterPipe::InPort template class

  tMode = ONE_PORT

<libspurs>
- QSortSubWithFetch() that is found in the following sample program 
  may write into an area immediately after the data array to be sorted 
  unexpectedly.
  samples/spu_library/libspurs/advanced/task_sort

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SPU ELF Binary Translator (replace_hbr.pl)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The target areas of the binary translator depend on whether or not
  an elf file contains section headers.

  - If an elf file contains section headers,
    the targets are executable sections.

  - If an elf file contains no section headers,
    the targets are executable segments.

  When an SPU program is written in assember, please be careful not to
  locate any data in the above sections or segments because they might
  be replaced by the binary translator.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
HID
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<libpad>
(Added in Version 132.002)
- cellPadLddRegisterController() that register a custom controller 
  always returns CELL_PAD_ERROR_TOO_MANY_DEVICES incorrectly.
  Although CELL_PAD_ERROR_TOO_MANY_DEVICES is returned, the custom 
  controller is mistakenly registered with the system.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
USB
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<USB Driver>
- When registration and deletion of an extended LDD are repeatedly 
  performed, the probe function may not be called at the registration.

- When performing isochronous IN transfer with a Full-Speed device, 
  data whose size per frame exceeds 512 bytes cannot be transferred 
  correctly. 
  This problem will be fixed in a future release. 

- Multi isochronous transfer of a High-Speed device is not supported. 
  This problem will be fixed in a future release. 

- From SDK090, the usbd/usbhphone sample is attached to LDD within 
  the system. Therefore, it does not operate. 

- When connecting or disconnecting a device to a USB port of the 
  machine body, other USB devices already connected may be 
  disconnected or may have an impact on its data communication.
  To avoid these problems, connect a self power hub to one of the USB 
  ports of the machine body.
