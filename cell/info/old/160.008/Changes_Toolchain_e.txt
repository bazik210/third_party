The following are the new features and fixed bugs of PLAYSTATION(R)3 
Programmer Tool Toolchain package. 

- Additions of new features and changes in Release 160.008
- Bugs fixed in Release 160.008

New Additions and Changes in Release 160.008
----------------------------------------------------------------------
GCC
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<PPU/SPU>
- A response file that was automatically generated with the compiler 
  driver use to be deleted when the command that was started with 
  the compiler driver ended without an error, but a change has been made 
  so that it is not deleted when the option -save-temps is specified. 

<PPU>
- A feature of detecting the occurrence of LHS (Load-Hit-Store) 
  which causes the reduction of PPU performance has been added 
  to the compiler. 
  If -mwarn-lhs is specified at the time of compilation, a warning 
  will be issued when the possibility of LHS to occur in the generated 
  code is high. 
  However, only when the options -mwarn-lhs and -g are specified 
  in combination, the source line where the warning occurred can be 
  identified. When the option -g is not used in combination, 
  please note that the possibility of the line number output to 
  the warning is not correct is high. 

  By default, the feature of detecting the occurrence of LHS which 
  causes the reduction of PPU performance is not enabled. 

- The performance of the intrinsic function __builtin_memmove has been 
  improved. 
  In previous compilers, __builtin_memmove was used only when 
  the copy source was a static const variable or the amount to copy 
  was 1 byte. Other than that, the library function memmove was called. 
  From ToolChain160, when other than the optimization option -O0 is 
  specified, __builtin_memmove will be used up to 32 bytes (the amount 
  to copy) even if the copy source is not a static const variable. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
GDB
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The following options have been added to the commands monitor load 
  and bedbg of ppu-lv2-gdb. 
  -exceptionhandler: 
    Option for making the exception handler feature provided with 
    liblv2dbg valid or invalid
  -remoteplay: 
    Option for selecting whether to automatically load or not to load 
    the prx for remote playback.

GCC
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<PPU/SPU>
- The following bug has been fixed: 
  - A program that used a response file could not be linked within 
    a folder whose name contained a space character.
  
<PPU>
- The linker used to end abnormally with a message such as below. 
  This problem has been fixed. 
  c:\usr\local\cell\host-win32\ppu\bin\..\lib\gcc\ppu-lv2\4.0.2\..\..\..
  \..\ppu-lv2\bin\ld.exe: BFD 2.16.1 (CELL 4.0.38, $Rev: 1058 $) assertion 
  fail /home/fnami/svn/toolchain/binutils/bfd/elf64-ppc.c:8260

- If an array of constant pointers to functions was defined as 
  a static variable, an internal compiler error occurred. 
  This problem has been fixed.
