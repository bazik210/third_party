- Bugs fixed in Release 310.001

======================================================================
New Additions and Changes in Release 310.001
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SN Systems Linker
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Additions]
(B#73814)
- Add support for compressed PRX output.

(B#65903,B#68320)
- Add support for large numbers of sections in output ELF files.

[Specification Changes]
(B#77712)
- Remove the --no-keep-memory command-line option.

(B#76969)
- Suppress DWARF .debug_info entries for discarded COMDAT functions.

(B#76191)
- Issue a warning message when command-line inputs are treated as 
  scripts because their type could not be determined.

(B#72624)
- Modified the FSELF implementation to reflect the current specification.

(B#72190)
- Reduce memory usage for large output files.

[Bugfixes]
(B#79969)
- Improve compatibility with GCC -mno-toc mode when dead stripping. 
  In severe cases, this issue could cause failure to correctly relocate 
  branch instructions.

(B#72768)
- Make all warning/error messages use the correct number of dashes when 
  referring to command-line switches.

(B#70351)
- Correct a dead-stripping issue that could cause the weak definition 
  for a symbol to be kept even if a global definition was present.

(B#67211)
- Fix a rare failure to de-duplicate objects referenced by both global 
  and local symbols.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
GCC
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Additions]
<PPU/SPU>
(B#74072)
- Added option '--binary-symbol-prefix <prefix>' to spu-lv2-objcopy
  and ppu-lv2-objcopy.

(B#76503)
- When using the compiler options -dp with -S or -save-temps, the 
  compiler will include critical path information in the assembly 
  output.

<PPU>
(B#75707)
- Added -mno-toc=<num> option.
  <num> should be one of '0', '1', '2'.
  -mno-toc=2 behaves same as -mno-toc (no trailing integer) of the previous 
  release.
  -mno-toc=1 is similar to -mno-toc=2, but keeps TOC save/restore instructions 
  around calls via function pointers.  This can be used to avoid the 
  limitation of -mno-toc of the previous release.
  -mno-toc=0 always emits nops and TOC save/restore instructions.
  The default is -mno-toc=0.

[Specification Changes]
<PPU/SPU>
(B#75017)
- The specification of the integral constant expression of C++ has been 
  extended to accept conversions to floating point types.
  The conversions must be operands of further conversions to integral or 
  enumeration types.
  If -Wno-constant-expression is specified, warnings on such conversions 
  are suppressed.
  If -pedantic is specified, such conversions are treated as errors.

<PPU>
(B#77237,B#77972)
- A part of the fix in SDK3.0.0 SDK package has been changed to be moved 
  to the toolchain.
  Now GCC defines CELL_GCM_SNC_NOTOCRESTORE_2 macro as a one of predefined 
  macros when -mno-toc or -mno-toc=2 is specified.
  To avoid the recurrence of the problem below, please do not combine 
  SDK3.1.0 SDK package and SDK3.0.0 toolchain package.
  - Problem with libgcm Caused by Enabling -mno-toc (GCC Option) for 
    Application Build
    (Technical Notes ID:200907-13  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/940)
  - Problem on incorrect dead-stripping of PRX

<SPU>
(B#75162)
- Improved the output of the linker option '--stack-analysis'.  When
  generating a map file with '-Map map.txt', '--stack-analysis'
  now prints a call graph with more details.

(B#76503)
- Improved performance and code size of generated SPU code by 
  reducing unnecessary nops and register copies.

(B#74827)
- Objects linked with -mspurs-job were changed from job_start_gcc.o 
  to job_start.o.

(B#73739)
- The algorithm for calculating the SPU GUID has been changed 
  to reduce the possibility of the identifier collision.

[Bugfixes]
<PPU/SPU>
(B#73429)
- The following internal compiler error might occur:
    internal compiler error: in int_mode_for_mode, at stor-layout.c:249
  This problem has been fixed.

(B#72731)
- The C++ preprocessor might cause segmentation fault.
  This problem has been fixed.

(B#66343)
- There was a problem in the behavior of qualified name lookup.
  The following example did not cause the expected error.
    namespace Y {
      void f();
    }
    namespace A {
      using namespace Y;
    }
    namespace B {
      void f();
    }
    namespace AB {
      using namespace A;
      using namespace B;
    }
    int main()
    {
      AB::f(); // error: call of overloaded 'f()' is ambiguous
               // candidates are: void B::f(), void Y::f()
      return 0;
    }
  This problem has been fixed.

(B#75704)
- Assume derived class D inherits from multiple classes with virtual methods.
  When casting a const reference of D to a non-const reference of 
  one of D's base classes, the resulting reference pointed to an incorrect 
  address.
  This problem has been fixed.

(B#76934)
- Context sensitive keyword vector might not be recognized correctly 
  when written as 'vector vector::xxx()'.
  This problem has been fixed.

(B#77076)
- The following internal compiler error might occur:
    internal compiler error: in import_export_decl, at cp/decl2.c:1727
  This problem has been fixed.

(B#77629)
- When SDK was installed other than /usr/local/cell, -frepo option did not work.
  This problem has been fixed.

(B#76337)
- Some error messages were not displayed with preceding "error:" strings.
  This problem has been fixed.

(B#77574)
- An escape character (\) did not work for doubles quote in the response file 
  of Windows.
  This problem has been fixed.

<PPU>
(B#72249)
- ppu-lv2-ar fails with the 'ru' command.  This has been fixed.

(B#75167)
- When the following code were optimized, x.f and y.f were allocated in the same register. 

  struct S {
    float f;
    int i;
  } __attribute__((d64_abi));

  struct S g(struct S x, struct S y)
  {
    struct S z;
    z.f = x.f + y.f;
    z.i = x.i + y.i;
    return z;
  }

  This problem has been fixed.

(B#74690)
- The following problem has been fixed:
  - Bug in PPU VMX Intrinsic Function "vec_lvlx"
    (Technical Notes ID:200908-02  https://ps3.scedev.net/technotes/view/944)

(B#77070)
- The following bug has been fixed.
  - The compiler crashed when using -mno-toc and optimizing code
    containing loops.

(B#71022)
- The following internal compiler error might occur in optimizing operations 
  on vector types.
  The problem has been fixed.
  internal compiler error: in rs6000_split_lve, at config/rs6000/rs6000.c:2931

<SPU>
(B#74996)
- The SPU linker crashed when using option --stack-analysis.
  This has been fixed.
