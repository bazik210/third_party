For Animation Writer to work properly it needs to have certain folders in certain places. These folders
are called SELS, POSES, and ANIMS. It is in these folders that Animation Writer will store Selection Sets, 
Poses, and Animation Sequences. These folders should reside inside of a project directory. Animation 
Writer has a menu function under Writer->Create Folders to automatically create these folders 
in a project directory if they do not already exist. You need only create these files once per project.<p>


When you create a subFolder, AnimWriter makes a folder of the specified name (suffixed with "_Folder") in each 
of the SELS, POSES, and ANIMS folders in which to store files created while that subFolder is the active folder. 
You can rename these folders without any problem. They'll show up with their new names the next time the 
AnimWriter window is refreshed.<p>

Basically what you wind up with looks something like this:
<pre>
|-Project
     |-SELS
        |-example1_Folder
        |-example2_Folder
     |-POSES
        |-example1_Folder
        |-example2_Folder
     |-ANIMS
        |-example1_Folder
        |-example2_Folder
</pre>


With the addition of the add/replace feature for stored selections in v1.1 the format of the .SEL file has 
changed slightly. Previously saved .SEL files will not work with the add feature. They will only replace the entire 
selection list. To fix this simply recreate all of your stored selections with v1.1 or later of jpAnimWriter. 
You can do this by double clicking the selection name, right clicking and selecting "Name--->", and then 
overwriting the existing file in the new format with "Write New File".
