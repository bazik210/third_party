<h3>Things to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implement the Blend Poses functions.
<li>Add more pasting options for animations.
<li>Maybe add animation retargeting functionality.
<li>Add Mac and *nix folder manipulation. Need access <br>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to a Mac and Linux/Irix box for this.
</ul>

		in the rename file window.

		create folders.
